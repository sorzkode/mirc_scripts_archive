# ![mirc_icon_182544](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e2efcd1-b885-457d-9917-fe91d421c202) mIRC Scripts Archive

Welcome to sorzkode's mIRC Scripts Archive - a comprehensive preservation project dedicated to collecting / documenting mIRC scripts.

## üèõÔ∏è Purpose

To preserve mIRC scripting history and culture. By hosting these files on GitHub, my hope is that they can live on for many more years.

## ü§î But Why?

Because scripting was my introduction to programming and I believe this is the case for a lot of coders from my generation. Oh, and because nostalgia is one helluva drug.

## üì∞ Background

In the 90s and early 2000s, when [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IRC) was really booming, [mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC) was the popular chat client. mIRC allowed users to customize / modify their experience by using the [mIRC scripting language (mSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_scripting_language). This was so popular that there were websites dedicated to hosting these user-built scripts. Now, many of those sites no longer exist (see links below for some that do). However, [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org) indexed many of those sites and some of the files can still be found.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Methodology

1. Used a Python script to leverage the Internet Archive's CDX (Canonical URL and Timestamp) API to download any available .zip files from the given sites. The original scrape was for the years of 1996-2008 only.  
2. Extracted some metadata about the files with another script but this isn't perfect.  
3. Used a script to delete many corrupted folders - original scrape count was nearly 3,000 files but over 1,800 were corrupted.

## üìù Archive Status

### Current State

- **Collection Phase**: ‚úÖ Complete (CDX API scraping finished)
- **Processing Phase**: üîÑ In Progress (sorting and cataloguing)
- **Documentation Phase**: üìù Ongoing (individual script READMEs)
- **Verification Phase**: ‚è≥ Pending (community verification)

### Future Plans

1. **Complete Cataloguing**: Finish processing all recovered scripts
2. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate file integrity and completeness
3. **Community Verification**: Seek input from original users/authors
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Add historical context and usage examples

### üò≠ Technical Limitations

- **Snapshot Dependency**: Only URLs captured by Internet Archive are available
- **Temporal Gaps**: Some periods may have limited or no coverage
- **Metadata Loss**: Correlating the .zip files to the corresponding information pages for the scripts can be tricky - even with web scraping

### üï∏Ô∏è Sites Scraped
