## üèõÔ∏è Preserving IRC History & Early Internet Culture

Welcome to sorzkode's mIRC Scripts Archive - a comprehensive preservation project dedicated to collecting, documenting, and maintaining historic IRC scripts from the 1990s and early 2000s. I will be building this out as time permits. I have roughly 1000 scripts from all the popular scripting sites that I have scraped and organized. However, some of the process is going to be a bit manual / slow.

## üéØ Mission Statement

This repository serves as a digital museum for IRC scripting culture, preserving an important era of internet history when IRC was a primary platform for real-time communication and community building. These scripts represent the creativity, ingenuity, and collaborative spirit of early internet developers and power users. This is special to me because it was my introduction to programming. I believe this is the case for a lot of coders from my generation.
