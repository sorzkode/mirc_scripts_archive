Away System 3.0 by LordViper.        \  

First, some info:                             \

-----------------------------------/

~1.0: Installing the away system.

First of all, unzip all of the files into a directory.

Then, come into mIRC, and type /load -rs location\aways.mrc

(location is where you put the unzipped file, I.E. C:\Unzipped or something like that.)

If you'll see a little square prompt, click yes.

The away system is loaded and ready to use.

~1.1: Using the away system.

You can define Function keys to handle the aliases, becuase you don't feel like typing or using the popups, do ya? :-)

All of the options can be configured throughout the popups.

Some nice features that the script has:

*No /ame flaw, e.g. It's won't result in an error, trying to /ame when you're not on any channel.

*Away nick - You can define an away nick, so that ppl that join the chan you're on will see that you're away.

Example: Say your nick is John. You set away, with away nick enabled and defined. Your nick now changes to the nick you specified, i.e. John[A], or John{A}, or John-Gone..You get the point.

*Quiet away option - Do I need to explain?

* Also, a message logger + CTCP pager are included in the script.

* Auto-Away - If you idle more than the time you specify, it sets you away automatically, if it's enabled.

Please, if you find any bugs, email me or find me on IRC - The server and email addies are at the top.
