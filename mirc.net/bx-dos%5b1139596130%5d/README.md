You'll need an mts engine that supports MTS format version 1.2 but 1.3 is recomdated.



How to install:



It depends of what engine you use.



I will explain how to load it on MTS loader v1.71, which is the MTS engine that I used while writting this theme:



 1 - Open up MTS loader main dialog. You can use the /mts command to do this;

 2 - Select menu "File > Add";

 3 - Go all the way to this theme path and select wang.mts file. It will appear at the themes list on the main dialog;

 4 - Select this theme from the list and click "load".



How to load it on Theme Engine MX :



 1 - Open the Load/Setup dialog;

 2 - Select menu "File > Open Folder";

 3 - Go all the way to this theme path and select bx-dos folder. It will appear at the themes list on the main dialog;

 4 - Select this theme from the list and click "Load".

Note: The preview is not accurate with Theme Engine MX v1.12 :((



How to load it on Eric^^'s M.T.E. (MTS Theme Engine) :



 1 - Unzip the files creating an bx-dos folder in Themes directory (Themes/bx-dos/*.*);

 2 - Open up MTS loader main dialog. You can use the /themes command to do this;

 3 - Select bx-dos.mts file from the themes list on the main dialog;

 4 - Click "Apply".



If you are using any other engine thats not MTS loader, check out its documentation to know how to load a theme; if you 

don't know what an MTS theme or MTS engine is, you might not understand what these files are all about, and its beyond

of this readme.txt file to explain in detail what all of this crap means. Check out http://www.mircscripts.org/mts.php
