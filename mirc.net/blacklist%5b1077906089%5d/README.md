   opped in. The addon can remember Hosts Or Nicknames and kick/ban/kick&ban them

   depends on your settings.

   REMEMBER this can get out of hand if you're not setting this right.

   DO NOT make this addon into a war addon, this is simply a user kicker!

      mIRC directory, but it should work anyway.

   2. Go to your mIRC, and type: //load -rs PATH/blacklist.mrc

      REPLACE!!! "PATH" with the location of the file. (blacklist.mrc)

   3. The Script will /echo you some information about the addon, read it and have fun.

     Nickname/host and a reason (optional), if the reason is null, the dfault

     reason will be in the kick reason.

  4. To set the Punish select between the Radio Buttons Kick/Ban/Kick Ban.

 

  5. In order to make a Temp ban (a bvan which remove itself after a given time)

     check the "Temp Ban" check.



  6. Set the Temp Ban time in the edit box near the "Temp Ban" check.
