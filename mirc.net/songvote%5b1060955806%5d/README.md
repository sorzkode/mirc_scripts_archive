Welcome To "Songs Votes" for Winamp Shoutcast Radio.



please know that if you don't know how to use WInAmp SHOUTcast Plugin,

this snippet may be useless for you, unless you want other people to

----------------------------------------------------------------------



1. Intrudaction.



The Snippet suppose to help Internet Radio Stations, which work with

Winamp "ShoutCast" plugin, to make Votes through mIRC.

on each round of votes, 10 random songs (mp3 files) get picked up.

the snippet sends the list to the channel and the users can vote for

their favorite song from the above list. once the Vote is over

(time can be set by you) the winning song is played instantly in mIRC

using "/splay", Winamp, which is already working and running "shoutcast"

Plugin (Which is set to broadcast any voice from your Soundcard) gets the

voice and send it to the net.

 

* for now, the vote can be done on one and only channel (whatever chanel

  you choose, ofcours).





2. Install.



simply extract the file into some directory in your mirc dir.

then go to your mirc, and type "/load -rs PATH/songvote.mrc"

replace "PATH" with the exact location of the file.



when the script is loaded a popup window will open and ask you to choose

a directory, this suppose to be you MP3 directory.

know that unless the directory contains .mp3 files, it won't work.



3. Directions.

   

   1. download "ShoutCast" plugin From www.winamp.com and install it.

   2. select the plugin inside winamp NOT mIRc!!! 

      by: ctrl+p --> plug - ins -- DSP/effect and highlight that "nullsoft SHOUT cast thing.



   3. a window will popup and this is the configuration options.

      you HAVE TO LIVE THIS WINDOW OPEN!!!



   4. go to "input" tab and select: input device --> soundcard input



   5. now live this and winamp windows open.



  

   * you need to know how to use Shoutcast, but this is not the place..

     im just saying the things that need to be done in order for this

     snippet to work properly.

   

 

   6. back to mIRC
