Thanx for using F-SERV EXPLORER :o)

I dedicate this script to ICFT (Internationale Confederation of Free Trader)       

If you think you can write that more clearer and whithout mistakes (I am sure you can) connatct me please

Please read this readme before you use F-Serv Explorer



This Files are in the trader.zip

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

trader.mrc

readme.txt

The script will create a fserv.ini file(setup is saved there) in scriptdir and temporary a fserv.dat (when you are on fileservers)



What It Is!

~~~~~~~~~~~ 

This is a simple little script that allows you to point and click your way through Fservers.

Couldn't be easier.

How you install it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you got a earlier F-serv explorer version pls delete all files and unzip than this one in your directory

Type in any Mirc window "/load -rs (unzip directory) +trader.mrc"

(eg If you unzipped trader.mrc and readme.txt in "C:\script\trader\"

you have to type "/load -rs C:\script\trader\trader.mrc" )

Now a mirc script warning box appears click the Yes button to go on.

New poups are addes to the Commands popups in menu line (under the blue bar at the top "Files" "Tools" "DCC "Commands"..)

The setup dialog will appear now with own help text in listbox (you can find this text too at the end of this file)

.View only files you can download with your current credit (Just view files you can download with your current credit)



F-Serv Filelist generator 1.0 (FSFG)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a basic filelist generator

YOu can generate fielist of your files ;o) so that F-Serv Explorer knows your files and can delete them in @Filez window

when you Check for double files

First you have to change a start directory its auto set to C:\ (eg its C:\ then FSFG will search all directorys in c:\

eg its C:\Files\ it will search all directories in C:\files )

in the edit box you can specify which file extensions you want add to your filelist (eg if you type ".jpg.gif.bmp" only those

three filetypes will be added to you filelist, because i think when a trader just trade with pictures you wont need

.exe.bat.dll in your filelist) so you can maybe make one filelist for mp3 one for pictures one for movies...

you can fats chnage them in setup so its no porblem 

and if you really need eg .??? in your "eg picture filelist" just enter the filename in filename box and choose the direcory

where the file is and the .??? filesnames will be added to your picture filelist... 



What can it do?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It checks for double files

It can show you which files you can downlod with your current credit (on supported servers)

It shows your current ratio and credit (on supported servers)

It says you if you have enough credits to download the files
```
