>> Introduction:

what is this?

well nothing much to say, this is a program, that is written in a language, which is 

supported by mIRC, and only mIRC can run it...

furthermore, this addon is called blacklist, a blacklist does the following:

1.Records all your enemies :), and lets you punish them or keep them away from you

2.Blocks spamming, and lets you punish those damn spammers :P



>> Installation:

How to install?

well unzip this pack, into your mIRC directory (Recommended)

and type:

/load -rs HDRX\blacklist.HDX

and it should work.., else if you put this in a different directory

you must specify the directory while loading ex:

if you unzipped this into this directory: C:/Addons/

you should type:

/load -rs C:/Addons/HDRX/Blacklist.HDX
