My First VB6 mIRC DLL

By MTec89 (mtec89net.com)



Original idea by eminence



steps to create your own DLL in VB 6: docs/mIRCVBDLL.html



example DLL: example.dll



example DLL SRC: example_src/example.vbp



Example DLL Functions: example.dll.functions.txt



example aliases: (in  mfvmd.mrc)



  /vbdll & /vbdll2 take paremeters, and return them back edited.

  /vbdll3 takes paremeters, but throws them away and doesn't use them.
