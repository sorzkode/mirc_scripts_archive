## 📋 Text Content (from shroudirc 3/data/kick.txt)

```text
That's the best thing about IRC: You don't need to jump off a bridge to receive the ultimate kick.

Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum. But I'm all out of gum.

There's the door. Please close it from the outside.

I say we throw him into boiling feathers and then tar him with a bag of tar. Or something like that.
