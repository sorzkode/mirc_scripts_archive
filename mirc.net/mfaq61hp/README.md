Frequently Asked Questions about mIRC

Last FAQ update: November 23rd, 2006

The mIRC FAQ is maintained by Tjerk Vonck



Latest mIRC version: 6.21, November 23rd, 2006.



The mIRC FAQ attempts to answer the most frequently asked 

questions about the Winsock IRC client mIRC, developed by 

Khaled Mardam-Bey. You are allowed to provide and distribute 

the mIRC FAQ -as is- by or on any medium as long as you make 

it available for free. You are not allowed to change anything 

in the file or charge any amount of money for your services. 

If you want to copy only certain parts for whatever use, make 

sure to mention my name and the FAQ as the source of 

information with every single quote whenever you publish it. 



This copy of the mIRC FAQ in Windows Help format allows you to

use mIRC's Dynamic Help Menu for fast access. Just place the 

mircfaq.hlp file in your mIRC directory (like c:\program files\mirc\ ). 

From that moment on you can access the FAQ from the Menu bar 'Help' 

item in mIRC. Also an automatically created  /mircfaq [topic]  

command will be available. Full topic search is possible by 

this command as well from within mIRC.
