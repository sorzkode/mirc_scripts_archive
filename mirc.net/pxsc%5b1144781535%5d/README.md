-----[ Description ]--------------------------------------------



This addon was designed to provide users with a clean,

well designed, and simple to use addon that will simplify 

his or her chatting experience. It also provides users with

the option of filtering out words other users input.



Thanks to Wikipedia for providing the list of often typo'd

words.





-----[ Manual ]-------------------------------------------------



Spellchecker: 



How it works:

The spellchecker was designed using hash tables. It will allow you 

to input the incorrect and corrected spelling of a word and then add 

it to the dictionary (or list of words).

When your casual typing along and accidentally typo a word found 

in the word list, it will retrieve the corrected spelling and replace it for you.



There are only three main functions needed to use this addon:

Enabling: An obvious one is turning the spellcheck function on/off. 

To do this simply click the 'Enable' check box.



Adding a word: To add a word to the dictionary, simply input the

incorrect spelling of a word followed by the correct spelling of the word, 

then hit 'Add'



Deleting a word: To remove a word from the dictionary list, find the

 word and click on it, then hit 'Delete'.





Filter: 



Added with the spellchecker is the ability to filter out words inputted 

from other users.



How it works:

The filter also use's hash tables to increase the speed performance.

It allows you to input the word you want filtered followed by the word 

you wish to see in it's place. When a user types a undesired word 

either in channel or in private, the filter will replace it with your version 

of the word.



There are only three main functions needed to use this addon:

Enabling: An obvious one is turning the filter on/off. To do this 

simply click the 'Enable' check box.



Adding a word: To add a word to the filtered list, simply input the 

word you want filtered followed by what you want it filtered as, then hit 'Add'.



Deleting a word: To remove a word from the filtered list, find the word 

and click on it, then hit 'Delete'.





Options: 



- Capitalize first letter in the sentence: Makes the first letter 

upper case. (Ex: hello friend = Hello friend)



- Capitalize week days & months: Makes week days and month names 

upper case. (Ex: monday = Monday)



- Capitalize countries: Looks through a list of countries and if it finds a match 

it will make the country name upper case (Ex: canada = Canada).



- Notify when using all upper case: When using all upper case letters a dialog 

will pop up asking if you'd like to send the text as it is, make it all lower case, 

or cancel sending the text altogethor.



- Add full stop to the end of sentences: Adds a '.' to the end of any sentence 

(Ex: hello = hello.)
