;  Scroll Pops - Verson 1.0

;  By DND

;-----------------------------------



-Intro-



Scrolling alert popups to keep you aware of events happening on IRC while your away doing something else.

Simply set the events you want to be kept aware of, or custom word triggers, then get on with whatever else

you wanted to do. When a selected event happens and mIRC isn't the active application a popup scrolls up

from your taskbar notifying you what's happened.  Click on the popup to make mIRC the active application again.





-Loading-



Unzip all the files in the zip file to your mIRC directory.  Open mIRC and type in any window:

//load -rs $shortfn($findfile($mircdir,scrollpops.mrc,1))

*amendment to loading instructions as requested.



-Usage-



The setup dialog can be openned either by type /spop or through the menu bar at the top of mIRC. Select

the events you want to be kept informed of and click the apply button. You must click the Apply button

for changes to be saved. 



Triggers are;

  Your nic: someone mentions your nic in a channel

  Notices: notice sent either to you or a channel your on

  Queries: when a private message is received - the trigger is when the chat window is openned so will

           only trigger on the first msg from that person until you close the chat window

  Notifies: when someone on your notify list logs on/off

  Invites: when you receive an invite to a channel

  Kicks: if someone (or you) is kicked from a channel that your on

  Bans: when a ban is placed on a channel that your on

  Custom words: you can enter custom words that you want to listen out for as demonstrated in screen

                shot. To add   custom words type the word in the edit field and click add.  Delete...well

                that's obvious :p





This is only the first version of this that i've released and am planning on integrating different themes

in the future so would be grateful for any feedback from people using this. Are there other events that you

would like to see incorporated or bugs you've come across, then please let me know.  Either leave a note on

the site you downloaded this from or contact me direct.
