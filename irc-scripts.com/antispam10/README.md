ANTI-SPAM VERSION 1.0 BY GORON1

-------------------------------



In case you didnt bother to read what this script

was before you downloaded it, it will save you

from thoes annoying spams people spread out. I

know there are lots of idiots out there who have

no clue what "Spam" is. Well, in IRC, spam is when

some jerk messages you to join their: Channel,

IRC Server, Webpage, Requesting a program, etc.



So, if youd like thoes to stop for good, youve

downloaded the most complete Anti Spam program out

there. (Well at least all the ones ive seen)



Anyways, you must by dieing to start... ;)



This .ZIP file you downloaded/got contains the

following files:



Antispam.mrc		The mIRC plugin file.

Antispam.txt            Hm.... I wonder....



The only thing you need for this script to work,

is the latest version of mIRC. 



So, you ready? Lets go!



1) Unzip the antispam.mrc file into your main mIRC

   directory. (The directory with mirc32.exe)

2) Close all open sessions of mIRC in case.

3) Open a new mIRC and do NOT connect.

4) In the STATUS window type in the following:

   /load -rs antispam.mrc

5) Connect to any server.

6) On connect you will be greeted. Read the message

   and click on OK.

7) Reconnect. (Newbies: Disconnect and Connect...)

8) Your done. The window @Anti-Spam is open, that

   is the main script window. Right click on it for

   options at any time.



So, got it working? Well, want a quick run of the

basic features? Ok, lets go!



1) Get a friend to spam you.

2) Notice the @Anti-Spam window tell you that. But

   It doesnt display all the info needed.

3) Right Click and select the first option.

4) Type in 1 and press OK.

5) WOW! All the message stats!



Thats all really you need to know, you can play with

the other things that i added.





So, what are you doing? Have fun on IRC for once!

Go bragging about Anti-Spam!

job. Also tell me of any bugs.
