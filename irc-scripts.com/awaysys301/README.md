1. Welcome to AwaySystem



Thank you for downloading AwaySystem 3.01 for mIRC 5.71. AwaySystem is a very

configurable, easy to use, and very advanced Away system for mIRC. Instead of 

the basic /away command that IRC gives you, with AwaySystem you have many more

options. You can receive CTCP Pages, AwaySystem can log messages (AwayLog) with 

your nickname or any other text you wish, display your going away to all the

channels you are in and much, much more. Please be sure to read the AwaySystem

Help file to get familiarized with all the features AwaySystem has to offer.



AwaySystem History: AwaySystem is an ongoing project developed by mudpuddle

(#Lounge_Legends on DALnet) back in October, 1999 because I used 

other Away addons but it seemed like one addon had something I liked, then

another had something else. So I decided to write my own. I take emails from 

people wanting features in an Away System that can't be found in a single addon,

and I incorporate them into future versions of AwaySystem. So be sure to drop me

a note if you would like a feature added in a future version!



--------------------------------------



2. Changes to AwaySystem 3.01 from AwaySystem 3



AwaySystem 3.01 has undergone a few changes.. Such changes is the re-merging of

the script files into one for simpler management. Intergrated Theme Import Wizard,

AwayLog Triggers, several tweaks to notices sent to users, AwaySystem Help file,

About AwaySystem dialog, sending notice when you're away to a user that has just

joined a channel and a few other minor enhancements.. Please see the AwaySystem 

Help for information on the new features.



AwaySystem help has been ported to the standard Windows Help format. Its pictures,

and links help the user more understand AwaySystem than could ever be possible with

the old style of Help.. It does have one limitation though. Because I don't have a 16-bit

help compiler, it only works under 32-bit windows (winhlp32). Sorry Win 3.1 users :(



Because of the script's size (about 80kb) it is not viewable/editable in the mIRC Editor..

You must use Notepad or some other text editor to view or modify this script.
