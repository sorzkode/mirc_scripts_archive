 Import Server 1.1

 by SoapForge, original concept by Jonathans

 http://ns.iwarp.com/mirc/





 Small utility that retrieves a list of connected servers on the

 network and adds any new ones to the servers.ini file 

 in a reasonable manner.





 To install, copy the is11.mrc file in to your mIRC directory

 and issue this command at the mIRC prompt:



  /load -rs is11.mrc





 Usage is /import [networkname]



 where [networkname] is a semioptional parameter used when the

 script is unable to figure out the name of the network by itself, or

 to override the name the script comes up with. This name is used 

 as the group to add the servers to.



 As there seems to be no way of retrieving port information for the 

 servers, each will default to 6666.





 Version history:



 1.0 First release

 1.1 Updated to make use of the /server command
