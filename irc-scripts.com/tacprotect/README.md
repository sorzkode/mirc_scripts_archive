By Kloony



Version 1.0a



I can be contected on DALnet, to get on that network you can 

type /server irc.dal.net or just Open the setup dialog /setup-prot

or via the menubar. Then Click on the link #HelpDesk to join

#helpdesk or the link "Kloony" to memo me on DALnet.  If you 

find a Bug that needs fixing or want to ask me about something in 

this script feel free to contact me by these means.



If you have not got A mIRC version of 5.81 or higher then this

script will not work for you. Go to htt://www.mirc.com/get.html

to get the latest version.



Instalation.



Instalation fot this is fairly simple once you have the file unzipped

makesure that all files go to the mirc directory. (if you are not sure 

where this is type //echo -a $mircdir In mIRC and place all the files 

in that folder) It will not function fully without the files in that

directory.



Once unzipped in the mirc directory open mIRC and in the status window

type /load -rs Protect.mrc (if you don't want to do this press alt+r 

then go to file and click load, then script, then find the filename and

click okay) It should Ask you if you want to perform the tasks the 

Scriptsasks this is to load all the other files into mIRC just to make

it easier.

It should also give you brief instructions on how to use it, or at 

least get started. There is help built into the dialogs with the 

click of a button but you can also refer to this file with the click

of a button in the setup dialog.





Useage



To use this protection you just have to open the setup dialog (or use 

the corresponding aliases ie. /swear /repeat /capskick /colkick /flood)

Each dialog is set up more or less the same for ease of use.  You 

enter the channels You wish to protech in the Bok at the top left then 

click add (be sure to add a # to the channel name ie. #HelpDesk) Then 

once you select the channel name in the list you will see teh options 

available to you, Its fairly self explanatory But The options are 

explained in the help menus on teh setup dialog.  The custom kick 

messages are common for each Channel this means that its not just a 

custom message for that type of protection.  You can change this 

message in each option But one one message for each channel.
