GAH! I hate these!



to load this script you need the two files:

SloMP31.mrc





then open mIRC and type: 

/load -rs SloMP31.mrc

if you have the files in a different directory than the mirc32.exe

add the path of the file.

EX: /load -rs C:\something\or\other\SloMP31.mrc



and click YES when it says if you want to run the functions.



uh, thanks.....

the first thing you want to do is configure the script:

right click in a channel window:

SloMP3>MP3 functions>display options



then, to play an MP3

SloMP3>MP3 functions>play MP3>whatever





like. enjoy.
