- Battle.Net client v.01 (Scripting by SyntheroS) -



==============

- Description

==============



Battle.Net should come with 2 files:

1) bnet - readme.txt (the file you are reading right now)

2) battlenet.mrc (the script file that you will use to install)



This script is an addon that will allow you to connect to any Battle.Net style server and

chat with other users on it. Please note that there is currently only minimal chan protocol

support, and I will be trying to add full support later on. The reason for this being that

I had to reverse engineer the entire chat system, and did not have a RFC or text file to

work from in order to build this, so please excuse some things that may not work entirely

correct.



===============

- Installation

===============



1) extract the file battlenet.mrc into any directory

2a) if you extracted battlenet.mrc to your mIRC directory, type /load -rs battlenet.mrc

2b) if you extracted battlenet.mrc to a directory other than your mIRC directory,

    type /load -rs <file location> (ex: /load -rs c:\testscripts\battlenet.mrc)

3) You should have been notified that Battle Net had been loaded, if you recieved an error

   message saying the file could not be located, or loaded, try repeating step 2.
