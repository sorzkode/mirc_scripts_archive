 simple clone scanner 02b (first public release)

 ===============================================



 what is this:							

 this is a clone scanner addon. what is a clone scanner? lets	

 talk about clones first. clones are user with 2 or more	

 clients with the same userhost, for example, *!*@what.is.com 	

 clone scanner is used to check if there are any clones in the	

 channel. simple enuf eh?					



 about author:							

 the author of the addon is HaNtU]uU[ (hantu too). he's a	

 helper from dalnet's #helpdesk and undernet's #mirc. feel free	

 to contact him on dalnet or undernet.				



 how to use:

 first, you need to get mIRC v5.8, or else the addon will not	

 work completely (ie. you will get a lot of unknown commands	

 and clone scanning will not work)

 then, after unzip this addon to any dir, use:			

 	/load -rs [dir\]clonescan.mrc

 after that, click ok if any initialization dialog come up.	

 lastly, type /clonescan [channel] to use the script.		



 copyright:							

 all the codes in clonescan.mrc are owned by hantu (the author	

 of the addon). this copy of addon cannot be used without the	

 author's permission. ask before you use the codes of the addon	

 in any way.



 ===============================================
