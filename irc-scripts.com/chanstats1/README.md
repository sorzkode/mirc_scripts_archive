| What It Does |

 --------------



You are using: Zmodem's Channel Statistics v1.00, by: Zmodem. This is a handy little tool that,

when you are connected and on a channel, can report to you all of the information from a certain

channel that you are on; such as: Number of people on that channel, Number of Operators, etc.

Once all information is gathered, a dialog will open up and display all of the information and

output a percentage of people to that of the amount of people in the channel.





NOTE: Each display will also generate a percentage of users to that of the amount of users

      in the channel.



	Total Users: Displays Total Amount Of Users Currently On That Channel



	Voiced: Displays Total Amount Of UsersWho Have +v(oice)



	Regulars: Displays Total Amount Of Users Who Are Not Opped Or Voiced



	Here: Displays Total Amount Of Users Who Are *NOT* /Away



	Away: Displays Total Amount Of Users Who *ARE* /Away



	IrcOps: Displays Total Amount Of Users Who Are IrcOps



	Open On Desktop Next Time: Opens The Main Dialog On The Desktop Next Time It's Loaded
