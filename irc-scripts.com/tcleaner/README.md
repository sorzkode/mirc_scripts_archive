## 📋 Text Content (from TCleaner.txt)

Ok, this is a pretty simple script, for finding a scripted trojan.



Basically a short while ago a friend of mine was infected with a mIRC scripted trojan.

So i wrote this little scriptlet to check all script files for a segement of the trojan that couldnt be changed.



The usage is pretty simple, place in to your mIRC directory..

type /load -rs TCleaner.mrc

the script will load and automatically check your files.

Once the scan is complete just unload the file.

/unload -rs TCleaner.mrc



if you have any problems or recomendations for the script please e-mail me at :



shadows@subdimension.com

or darkness@subdimension.com



Thank You, SHaDoWS =o)
