	@Locator Version 1.0		April '99



Description:

^~^~^~^~^~^~

   This script allows you search for files containing the words of your specified search pattern and will display it to you in the Status Window.



   Other people may also search your directories for files matching their given search patterns by using '@Locator <search pattern> (without the <>'s) in any channel or private query window that they may have with you.



   Once a search has been completed, instructions will also be given to them on how to download a file of their choice. A person may only download a maximum of 3 files from you at the same time.



   The script also has a built-in flood protection. If there are more than 5 matches to a search pattern, then it will list these files with a delay of 3 seconds between each line.





How to install this script:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^



	Your remotes has to be on for any scripts to work. Type:



		/remote on



	In any of your mIRC windows. It should say something like:



		*** Remote is ON (Ctcps,Events,Raw)





***

  If you downloaded this script from a webpage, then move the script to your mIRC directory. Type:



	/load -rs locator.mrc



  in your Status Window.



***

  If you got this script via DCC send from someone over IRC, then type:



	//load -rs $getdirlocator.mrc

  You can also load the script manually. Go to the TOOLS menu on the top and choose REMOTES. Once inside Remotes, choose LOAD SCRIPT from the FILE menu. Select locator.mrc and press on OKAY. The script should be loaded.





Comments:

^~^~^~^~^



   You may distribute this script anywhere you like. All I ask is that you'll always include this Text File (Unchanged please) if you do. It can help many a Newbie to install the script. Also, I worked very hard at this script and purposely didn't put any logos within the script itself. Please keep it that way and don't claim it as your own.
