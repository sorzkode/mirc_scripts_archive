dna: mp3 player addon v1.2

=====---------

by:  rche (ryche@edgenetwk.com)

url: http://ryche.edgenetwk.com

=====---------

requirements:  mIRC version 5.8+ (not compatible with lower versions)

=====---------

  This script uses mIRC 5.8's new mp3 options.  It's a fully functional mp3 player, with a good amount of use.

=====---------

how to install:

  To install this addon, load up mIRC and type this in: /load -rs dna_mp3addon.mrc

  It will then prompt you to decide if you want to assign the dialog to a F-key and if so then what F-key you want to use for when you want to open the mp3 player's dialog. Don't (I repeat DONT) assign an F-key to this addon that is already assigned to another thing or it won't work. You can always get to the dialog by right-clicking in a channel window. 

 

how to uninstall:

  To uninstall this addon, just type: /uninstalldnamp3

  This will prompt you to make sure you want to uninstall it, and if you click YES, it will do so.

=====---------

notes from author:

-

  If you are listening to a song and you close the dialog, it will continue playing.  If the song ends and the dialog isn't open, the player will stop playing.  I did this for many reasons, of which I will not describe here.

-

  If you wish to run any other addon or script (except dna, since it already has this player in it), go ahead.  This script should not conflict with them unless it is an F-key problem, of which you can fix yourself by loading the mp3 player via typing: /dnamp3 , and it should allow you to find another F-key for you to use.

-

  A tip about the sorting, DO NOT use it on really big playlists because it will take forever to get it sorted correctly.  It's just how I have the sort written, sorry.  It will sort, just expect it to take awhile. :)

-

  If you experience the problem with the script creating 1kb files, please send me an email.  I've heard it did this in an older version and I'm not sure if I fixed it or not.

-

  On a final note, if your mp3 has more than one space between letters (ex: te<space><space>st.mp3), mIRC MAY NOT run it.  I've had some people tell me that their mp3s like this won't run and some say that they will.

todo:

history:



-1.2

FIXED:

--an error with the default mp3 message not being set at installation (forgot to put set %dna.mp3.message, but i did have the message there :\)

--a bug in the uninstall that wouldn't delete the variables for this addon.

--a bug in the deletion of a mp3 from the list.  If it was from WinAmp or another mp3 player that adds #EXT before each mp3, then the dialog would only delete that and miss the actual mp3.  Now it does both if #EXT is found.

--an error with having a playlist that doesn't exist.

--an error with the PLAY button not playing mp3s with a path like d:\music\my.mp3

--an error that is produced when viewing the Status Window and you play a mp3.

--an error caused when you click PLAY without having an mp3 selected.

ADDED:

--the ability to do stuff for the mp3 player by right clicking in a channel window (Launch, Uninstall, or view the readme)

--a check at the installation to ask if people wanted to assign a Fkey or not to the dialog. (Select None if in dialog)

--ability to load either .m3u playlist or .pls playlist.

--Sorting! (took me 3 days and loss of sleep to come up with a way to do this, enjoy)

MISC:

--redid the Fkey stuff so it's much better looking and works a lot better.

--updated Notes from Author in this readme.txt

--changed the function of the NEW Playlist so you can actually tell where to save the playlist and under what name.

--got the STOP button to stop for anything played within on:mp3end.



-1.1

--added a check to make sure the user inputs a valid F-key when installing this addon.

--fixed a problem with the mp3 player not selecting what song was playing after closing and reopening the dialog

--added the ability to select how you want to broadcast your mp3 in the mp3 player.  You can either select Local for your active channel or Global for all the channels you are in or None for nothing to be displayed.

--added the ability to set your own message for when you play an mp3.   Here's an example: is currently listening to  [mp3]  . The [mp3] indicates the mp3 you are playing.

--added the ability to retrieve to and save those mp3 messages to a file.

--updated the uninstall function to include the new settings and to be more accurate on w
