|-----About R.I.P. Mp3------|

=============================



R.I.P. Mp3 Was made for people to use instead of winamp or any other mp3 program it was 

intended to use less ram but still give the user a health amount of options.

In many peoples opinion that i released beta test to say its one of the best they have seen.

So in closing i really hope you like this mp3 player as much as they do.
