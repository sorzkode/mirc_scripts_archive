Requirements:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^



This addon requires mIRC Version 5.51 or higher

	Get mIRC at http://www.mirc.co.uk/get.html

		    http://www.mirc.org/



Installation Instructions:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~



1) Unzip the *.zip file into your mIRC directory or your mIRC Scripts directory

2) Open mIRC and type into the command line: /load -rs capskick.mrc

	- If it's in a directory other than the main mIRC directory then you also have 

	  to specify the directory. Example: /load -rs c:\whatever\capskick.mrc

					     /load -rs c:\mirc\scripts\capskick.mrc

3) All the options are available in the Status, Menubar and Channel Popups



How to use this script:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^



- Use the Popups or the Dialog option to configure all the settings *before* you start

  running the script

- You may choose what percentage of caps the script will kick for

- You may choose to have up to 5 warnings/actions and you may set their appropriate

  warning/kick messages (temp ban or ban) via the dialog menu.

- You may set a list of users unaffected by the script (by address/mask)

- You *have* to set the channels for which the script works in

- You may choose to disclude ops & voices from the effects of the script



How this script works:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~



  Basically, all the options and the unaffected user list is saved in the *.ini files



Acknowledgments:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~



- Thanks to Pasmal for writing the Dialogs Tutorial - it helped me a lot at the

  beginning (http://www.helpdesk.mircx.com/documents/scripting.html)

- Thanks to IC for writing the $pcaps() identifier - the heart of the script

- Thanks to MIMP for being partially responsable in getting me to script in the

  first place and for always being there to encourage me - besides being a 

  wonderful friend



Comments:

^~^~^~^~^



- This addon resembles my Swear Kick addon in both looks and structure - for a very

  good reason. I used that addon to make this one. In fact, it was simply copy &

  paste and a lot of modifications to the result

- If you find any bugs, please contact me - if I don't know about the faults, I can't

  fix them right? ;)

- If you have a problem with the script, questions or requests for additional features,

  feel free to email me - ladydana@animefan.org - I might not reply promptly, but I will

  reply sometime.
