- CNICK Script v.14 for mIRC v5.71+ (Scripting by SyntheroS) -

==============

- Description

==============

This is a script which will allow you to create your own colorized version of your nick,

and share it with other CNICK Script users. When talking in channels it will then replace

their regular nick with the CNICK version they reported to you, if they have that feature.

mIRC v5.7 or lower

-----------------------------------------

This script does not mix will with other scripts, it works fine by itself and anything

beyond that is not known. If you load this and you experience problems such as not seeing

colorized nicks, not being heard by others, or saying the same things twice, then this

script is probably not compatible with your current base script. Granted, it is meant as

an addon, but not to other scripts that make such heavy modifications so that it would

disrupt CNICK's operation.
