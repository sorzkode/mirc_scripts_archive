I. Installation:

	unzip ajoin_1.mrc into your mirc\ directory then type:

	/load -rs ajoin_1.mrc

        after that it should be in the menubar of your mIRC



II. Instructions:

	After you have opened the script you will notice that almost

	everything is disabled thats so the script doesn't screw up 

	and crash mirc on you....Click "Add" in the Server Group Frame

	you will then be prompted to Enter the name of the Network you

	want to add channels to, Make sure its the exact name of the

	network, if your not sure what the exact name is type:  

        //echo -a $network

	if nothing comes up then the server probably doesn't support

	that command for instructions how to make it work read the Note

	posted at the bottom of this page. After you Enter the name of

	the network your on hit "Ok" (as if you didn't know :P) then 

	in the combo box in the Server Frame click the arrow on the 

	right side of it then locate the network you just entered and 

	then start entering channels that you want to join when you 

	connect. thats it, if your still having trouble e-mail me at,

	osiris998@hotmail.com with your question and i'll get back to 

	you as soon as i can.	



III. New in Version 1.0:

	Some Bugs Fixed. You no longer have to Remove the 

	"(Remove This)"



IV. Comments:

	if you use this in ur script please don't try to rip it and

	say its your own i worked hard on this....I just learned

	dialogs the other day and i didn't learn just so you could

	pass my work off as your own. Thanks.



*** Note:

	If your a newnet user you have to make sure you have the

	Word "NewNet" in the group edit box of ur newnet server

	for some reason $network doesn't work on NewNet...if your

	not sure how to add newnet to ur server list..open the jpg

	"Help.jpg" and it'll show you.
