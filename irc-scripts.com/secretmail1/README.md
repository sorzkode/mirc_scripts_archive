::About::.

Secret Mailer is an anonymous emailer. It will send email to anyone you

choose to send mail to, but you can use a fake reply email address. It

doesn't have to exist. Now your IP/host will show in the email. So it's

not totally anonymous, but there are anonymous email servers out there

that you can use. I supplied a NON-anonymous email server which is owned

by a friend of mine (MuD). So don't abuse that server if you choose to 

use it. This mail server won't work for ALL emails. Some mail servers

won't send because your fake reply address can't be resolved. So look 

around for some mail servers. (Just a warning)

::Disclaimer::.

I am NOT responsible for any illegal use of this addon. If you get in 

trouble using it, it's your own ass!
