Version 1

mIRC version 5.8+



What is it?



  Simply this lets you control your #groups With A little more ease. 

  Currently this manager is Only concerned With #groups. Which are a

  little simplistic to work with. However in later versions I am 

  expecting to create a feature to work with 'modules' to easily 

  control how when and with what Scripts you can use you commands. In

  a way make local aliases that can be Access By Other Scripts you 

  Choose.



Installation

  

  You just have to unzip the files to the Same Directory and Then 

  /load -rs /path/to/amanage.mrc (for more info see /help /load)

  From this you will get on Screen instructions as to how to use it.



Problems

  

  You can contact me via the help menu in the amanage dialog either by

  sending a memo or visiting #helpdesk on DALnet. I'll be glad to Help

  you with anything (even something totally unrelated ;))
