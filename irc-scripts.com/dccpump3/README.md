                                            1. Introduction 

	Thanks for downloading Dcc Pump Version 3!  There were 2 Previous versions of Dcc Pump.  Neither were really

publicly released.  Because neither were very good. :/  But this version I feel should be publicly released.  So, I

did.  Heh.  I spent about 2+ weeks makeing this script.  While working on 3 other scripts.  Well, I guess I finally

got this script done.  Well enjoy.  And remember, Don't rip, you can use my code for help and insperation, but don't

rip.  Don't think I won't find out :)









                                                 2. FAQ 

   Question #1: Whats a "FAQ"?

     Answer #1: FAQ stands for "Freaquently Asked Questions."  'Nuff said' :P

   

   Question #2: OK.  I've downloaded you're script.  Now what?

     Answer #2: Ok, Unzip these files in this zip achive to your mIRC directory (if you don't know where that is,

                its usually C:\mirc\).  Then launch (run) mIRC and type this (in a textbox),

                //load rutro-dccpump3.mrc.  Then a box will come up, press YES.  If you accidently pressed no,

                type //unload -rs rutro-dccpump3.mrc | //load -rs rutro-dccpump3.mrc and press yes.  Then you can

                access DCC Pump 3's many features by right clicking the channel window.  If you need ADDITIONAL help

                ask someone you know.  Or e-mail me at ssj4-goku@dbzmail.com! :)



   Question #3: Theres a file in my mIRC directory called dlsendlog.txt! And it wasn't there until I loaded your

                script!  What is it?

     Answer #3: This is one of the many great features of Dcc Pump 3.  That file is a log of all of your dcc sends

                and recives while Dcc Pump 3 is turned on. To view that file eather double click on the icon or

                type /view.log in mIRC.



   Question #4: I'm getting an error that looks like something like 

                * /aline: invalid window (line 106, rutro-dccpump3.mrc).  What should I do?

     Answer #4: Don't Close the window that Dcc Pump 3 Creates!  It is like a session log.  If you would have read

                the window, you would have knew :/ Read stuff! :P
