I have learned to script from someone who has been scripting for years

so my scripts are always dont to the fullest and best of my ability. I am usualy

in a chan so that you can find me for questions. And if you cant find me you

lyrics on the Internet. If you want lyrics e-mail my staff at querklyric@hotmail.com.

They will help you find your lyric.

2.)I  made this autovoice because I was always in need of one. The autovoice

voices people in a chan you are op in either if they send a LIST ad or a MP3 ad.

This script only will only work if your an OP. 

********************************************

3.)To install script use WinZip to UNZIP to your mIRC folder (i.e C:\mirc).

Then start up mIRC and go into a chan then type in /load -rs voice19.mrc

And then type     /remote on    so that your remote scripts will turn on and

the AutoVoice will be active.
