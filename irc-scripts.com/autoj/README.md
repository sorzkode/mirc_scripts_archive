 Description:

 ============



 This auto join script allows you to join a list of channels depending on the

 server you are on. It also allows you to configure more than one list

 per network,  actually up to  8 lists  each! You can configure  the time and

 whether you would like to enable/disable it.













 Installation:

 =============



 To install this script simply follow the following steps.



 1) Download the file 'autoj.mrc'.

 2) Copy or save it on the same directory as the mIRC32.exe file is in.

 3) Run the file mIRC32.exe and type '/load -rs autoj.mrc'.

 4) Read the following part of the document to learn about configuring and 

    and running the auto join script.













 Configuration:

 ==============



 After you have loaded the autoj.mrc file, pres Ctrl+F8 and a dialog should

 popup.

 

 To add/remove a Channel to any of the lists.



 1) You have to click on the *number* in the list first.

 2) After selecting a number, enter a channel name in the list box then

    click the '+' sign.

 3) To remove a channel simply select it from the list and click the '--'

    sign.

 4) After you are finished with one list you have to click 'OK' or 'Apply'.

    If you don't and you click on another number, the list will disappear!



 To Set the time interval.



 1) Just enter the number of seconds you would like to join a list of channels

    and click 'Apply' or 'Ok'.

    note: The number of seconds determine the amount of time after you have

          connected to an IRC server.



 To Enable/Disable the Auto-join script.

 

 1) Simply click on the "Enable" link at the top to toggle between them.













 IMPORTANT NOTE:

 ===============

 

 To Select the list of channels you would like to join, CLICK on the NUMBER of 

 that list THEN CLICK 'Apply' or 'OK'. If you don't do that, it will join the

 list number '1' of that selected network.













 Known Bugs:

 ===========



 It just happens that the EfNet list is also compatible with other servers

 i.e. Undernet, StarNet, Action-IRC etc



 This is because the $network identifier has a $null value in those servers

 including the EfNet server!



 If you have no idea what i am talking about, then no need to worry :)

 Have fun and Enjoy! :-)
