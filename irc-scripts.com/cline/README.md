	Cline Script v1.0		May '99



Description:

^~^~^~^~^~^~



  The script is a typical script for colouring the nickname list. You can access the script via 

the menubar, channel or status popups (just right click in one of the above-mentioned sections).



  You get to choose the colours that you would like and you may also change the presentation of 

the channel text if it's an op or a voice speaking.



  Please note that it will *not* colour your nick when you talk, but only the nicks of other

people. It would have required the use of On INPUT with halt, something that I'm reluctant to

do, since it will prevent the usage of any other scripts using On INPUT such as Nick Completers,

etc.



How to install this script:

^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^



	Your remotes has to be on for any scripts to work. Type:



		/remote on



	In any of your mIRC windows. It should say something like:



		*** Remote is ON (Ctcps,Events,Raw)





***

  If you downloaded this script from a webpage, then move the script to your mIRC directory. Type:



	/load -rs cline.mrc



  in your Status Window.



***

  If you got this script via DCC send from someone over IRC, then type:



	//load -rs $getdircline.mrc



***

  You can also load the script manually. Go to the TOOLS menu on the top and choose REMOTES. Once 

inside Remotes, choose LOAD SCRIPT from the FILE menu. Select cline.mrc and press on OKAY. The script 

should be loaded.





Comments:

^~^~^~^~^



	You may distribute this script anywhere you like. All I ask is that you'll always include 

this Text File (Unchanged please) if you do. It can help many a Newbie to install the script. Also, 

I worked very hard at this script and purposely didn't put any logos. Please keep it that way and 

don't claim it as your own.





	You can even change the messages in the script if you like. It doesn't really matter to me :)
