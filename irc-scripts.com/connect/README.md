======== Connect 1.0  ========== http://alidon.cjb.net ========= May 04 2001 =========

======================================================================================



Connect 2.0 is a useful tool in connecting to various irc networks, storing nicknames,

channels, their passwords, and options to auto identify for both, and auto join for

channels.  Also included is a manager for BNC users.



Sorry, couldn't get anyone to test it for me.



If other people use your computer, they will be able to see your passwords and identify.

So you definately don't wanna use this in a computer cafe or something!  At home, can 

you trust your friends and family?!



I released this as an addon cuz I'm not so sure my Full Script will ever be done!









======================================================================================

=================================== Files Included ===================================

======================================================================================



readme-connect.txt - This File!

servers.ini        - You don't really need this, you already got it.  But if you want 

                     a few extra servers to choose from, replace it!

connect.mrc        - The script itself.

connect.ini        - Where your data is saved to.













======================================================================================

================================== Install ===========================================

======================================================================================



To install, unzip all files to your main mirc directory, then in mirc type: 



/load -rs connect.mrc



To use, in mirc just right click and choose Connect, or type /connect







======================================================================================

=============================== Descriptions =========================================

======================================================================================





Servers - The networks are on the left.  Click one, and the script will search 

          servers.ini for it's servers.  They will appear on the right.  It could take 

          a second or two.  Now double click one of the servers on the right to connect!

          

          

BNC     - Bouncers, you probably won't need this.  A person connects to a BNC, then 

          connect to their normal IRC network from the BNC.  This gives them the BNC's 

          IP address.  Some people can't live without them so I included it.  I've 

          only used a BNC like twice so I'm not an expert!  I hope I got the commands 

          right!

     

     

Nicks   - Keep track of your nicks and their passwords.





Chans   - Keep track of your channels and their passwords.  If you only add the channel 

          for auto join and you don't have the channel password, just make up a fake one 

          and don't identify!
```
