Regardless of what one's expectations might be upon hearing the name of this

script, it actually is what it says it is.  It's a client, and a non-specific

one at that.



Mostly a dev tool (what else could you do with it?), I've decided to release it

to the world and spread the wealth.  Similar to PNP4's login.ppa, although

I "borrowed" this idea from a DOS app of the same name :P



Use of this is quite easy.  A client window is opened with, appropriately enough,

the /client [number] [server] [port] command, where [number] forces it to open

a specific window (eg. /client 316 opens @client[316] and uses the socket 

client316, ect.).  [server] and [port] are self explanatory.  From inside a window

there are only two commands, /close and /open [server] [port] (guess what they do

:P)  In case typing isn't your strong point, you can access these from the 

elite dynamic popups in each window.



Some might say that this is a small script, but if you're any suggestions 

on how to pad it out, by all means, send them.  But leave the "31337 ASCII popups"

suggestions for something else.  Also send bug reports (ha).
