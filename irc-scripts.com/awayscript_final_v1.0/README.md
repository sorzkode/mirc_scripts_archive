     hey this is my first script for mirc. hope you enjoy it :))            

     to load it copy it in your mirc main dir and type in any window        

     /load -rs away.mrc                                                     

     to get it work properly you have to setup the timer frequency, a normal

     and an away nick. to do this use the channel popup menu.               

     added some new feature so there are also the colors to be setup :)
