Explanation:



In BotMode, the WhoisBot will automatically run everytime a user signs online.

This means that a small dialog will appear, and give you the option of clicking the users nick.

When clicking the users nickname, a /whois will be performed on them.



the /whois result will echo into a custom window.



Manual Mode allows you to enter a nickname yourself to perform a /whois on,

Through a similar dialog as the one in BotMode.



Help:

To exit the custom window, simply click the "Exit" button in the dialogs.

The Bot will automatically turn off when connecting/disconnecting from a server.
