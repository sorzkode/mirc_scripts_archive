Telnet v1.0

 by: Zmodem





Okay, I could see that everyone was pissed off that there was no telnet script that worked

all that well. This is NOT an easy telnet script for new people. If you know how to use Shell

commands and what not on systems, you can use this script. It is made for advanced users who want

a smaller telnet than the included mIRC version. You can do just about anything you want, and, to

my knowledge, the error handleing is quite good. I hope you enjoy this!





-=Installation=-



To install this addon, unzip it anywhere, and type:

                                                    /load -rs path.to.file\telnet.mrc





-=How To Use=-



The instructions are very simple: Go into mIRC, right click in any window, OR click in your

menubar and locate the 'mIRC Telnet' popup. Click on it, the rest will be up to you! :)



-=Plans?=-



Currently, there aren't any future plans for this script. It is a means of an easy telnet, that's

all, nothing more. Yes EASY telnet. Telnet is easy for telnet users, not beginners. If you would

like me to release another, more in depth version of this script, with more features, I don't

really know what I could add, please e-mail me at: justinterri@netzero.net with your suggestions.

Thank you!

inittab: A.K.A. Gave me the idea to do something with sockets after having that knowledge dormant

         for around a year :) Thanks COLDSTEEL!
