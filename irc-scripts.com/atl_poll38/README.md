 -----====== Atl Poll v3.8 by CQAtlantis ======----

    

 Info:

 -----

    

    This is the simplest and easiest to use poll

  script ever made. To conduct a poll all you need

  to do is goto CHannel Menu > Atl Poll > Start.



 Install:

 --------

    

    To install put the file atl_poll38.mrc in your

  mirc directory. Then Type: 

    

               //load -rs atl_poll38.mrc

    

 --------------------------------------------------

    

 Use:

 ----

    

    To use this script type [ /apstart Topic ] or

  tight click in the chat window or any window and

  goto Atl Poll and click on [ Start ].



    You will then be promted to fill in a topic

  and four options. Once finished the poll will

  display the poll topic and options so that the

  users can vote. People will vote by typing "!"

  then the number by the option they want to vote

  for. The script dosn't allow anyone to vote

  twice. It stores the users host address so even

  if they change  nicks they still wont be able to

  vote again. 

    

 --------------------------------------------------

    

 Version Detail:

 ---------------



    3.8:

  1. Fixed the uninstall so that it works.

  2. CHanged the layut of the poll when it first

  displays so that it is on three lines.



    3.4:

  1. AFixed the change name cheat. Now it logs the

  host address instead of the nick.

  2. Completly redid the whole thing to make it as

  simple as humanly posible. Instead of having

  five options to run it there is only two.



    2.1:

  1. This is the first beta release. It was my first

  attempt. So please don't let this  version

  discourage you from trying the next one.
