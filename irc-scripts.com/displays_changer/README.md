  INTRODUCTION

This addon gives you the abillity to change the way basic events look in mIRC.You can 

simply change the way joins/parts/quits/etc. appear.In order to use all of the functions 

in this addon you need to have some knowledge in mIRC scripting,but it ain't that hard 

to understand the way this addon works and is used

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INSTALATION AND DEINSTALATION

To install the addon simply unzip the files in yuor mIRC directory and type:

/load -rs theme.mrc

Or press ALT+R,then go to File menu,Load,Script,and choose the file theme.mrc,press OK



To Uninstall type:

/unload -rs theme.mrc

Or press ALT+R,and from View menu choose theme.mrc.Then from File menu choose Unload

Or use the popups:)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HELPFULL TIPS

1.You may use bold,underlined and colour codes in events prefixes/suffices.Althought it's

not necessary to halt them,i reccomend you do that(I've probably forgot to use plain text

everywhere:)In other way the effect may be far away from what you've expected:)

2.The editboxes for each event are "endless",so you may not only use *,>,! and stuff like 

that but words too.For example you may type in the first editbox for join:

>>> The channel was entered by 

and leave the secondeditbox empty,and unchek the "Show chan" check.This will result in

>>> The channel was entered by vasil (~!Gandalf@RinEnnor.Tolkien.Society)

3.When you mess up all the displays just press "Reset to defaults" button ;)

This will bring back the mIRC's default displays(well,almost;))

4.This addon works with timestamp!

5.If you leave the "Show chan/address" check unchecked the channame/nickaddress will NOT 

be displayed.So be careful when you uncheck these

6.All(i hope) of the codes you'll usein prefixes/suffices will be halted and won't apply

to the rest of the display.The main colour can simply be choosed from the mIRC Colours

dialog,as in the pure mIRC.This does NOT mean that the displays mey be only in 1 colour

For example type 14>15>> in one of the prefixes editbox,and you'll get colour output

which consist of dark grey,light grey,and the main colour for that event





For newbies-if you wonder WTF do these $nick,$knick,$me mean just press F1 and read!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some final notes

This addon has one significent lack-the raw codes display.I haven't mess with them cause

i'm kinda lazy.They are simply too much to let you change each one of them.I've thought 

about letting you change at least the whois reply,but...In the next version maybe ;)



Feel free to e-mail me any changes you made in this addon.I hope they will be something 

usefull,not only changing the size of the dialog ;b.Any bugs too.



Well,enjoi!
