-----[ ProjectX ]-----------------------------------------------

ProjectX is a Scripters Crew that focuses on creating scripts,
mainly mIRC-scripts. Not just one kind of script but all-kinds.
We create Practical Scripts for the lazy IRC-user, Protection
Scripts for the threatend one, Warscripts for the aggressive or
vengeance-seeking among us.

We are an organised group of scripters determined to help each
other create, develop and refine scripts. We bundle our 
knowledge, so that the inexperienced scripters may benefit from
our experienced crew-members and our experienced crew-members
benefit from the enthousiasm and fresh insights from our
less-experienced members. We are not trying to create the
'ULTIMATE' script, there is no such thing. We concentrate on
creating good, reliable, compatible and useful scripts for mIRC
users.
