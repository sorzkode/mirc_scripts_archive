1. Files
   Files included in mp3.zip:
      1. mp3.mrc  (main routines file)
      2. mp3a.mrc (menu/popups file  )
      3. mp3.txt  (you're reading it )
   If you do not have all these files, contact me by email or IRC.

2. Installing
   READ THIS!$@ Its how to install the script:
      1. Unzip the files in mp3.zip to your mIRC v5.4 or higher directory.
      2. If not already, open mIRC.
      3. In ANY window with a text-box, type /load -rs mp3.mrc
      4. Fill in any and all information asked for.
   This script will automatically attempt to find your MP3 directory and
   the path to Winamp, (since it is the most popular). Don't worry if it
   doesn't displays either wrong, you can always change it in setup.

3. Commands
   These are the 928358923 commands:
      /mp3 <spec|rand|last|stop|list|text|player|setup> [string]
         - spec [string]
           Lets you choose a file. If you specify [string] it will try to
           find an MP3 file with [string] in it. (You can use wildcards)
         - rand
           Plays a random MP3.

           Stops the current MP3 you're playing.

           Opens the GUI MP3 Playlist. This has a list of all the MP3's found
           in the MP3 directory you specified on the right, and buttons on the
           left to control them.
         - text
           Makes a list of all the MP3's found in the MP3 directory you specified
           in a text file.
         - player

           play. "Stop" will stop the current MP3 you're playing. "Random" will
           play a random MP3. "Last" will play the last MP3 you played. "Exit"
           will close the Player and stop the current MP3 you're playing. The
           "Repeat" Checkbox will allow you to repeat the MP3 you're currently
           playing. The "Shuffle" Checkbox will allow you to play a random MP3
           when one ends.
         - setup
           Opens up the MP3 Setup dialog. "Directory to MP3's" is where your
           MP3 files reside on your Hard Drive. "Path to Player" is the full
           path to the program you use to play your MP3's. "Show MP3's when
           played" will show the stats of an MP3 you play in a channel or
           status window, depending on what's the active window. "Allow users
           to "steal" MP3's" will allow anyone who wants an MP3 from you to
           get it by typing something like "!yournick mp3 file.mp3." "If exists,
           play MP3 on request" will play an MP3 when someone does a /ctcp SOUND
           or /ctcp MP3 to you and you have that MP3.
