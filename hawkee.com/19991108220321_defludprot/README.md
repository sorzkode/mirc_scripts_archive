*******************************

Thanks for your interest in DeÔøΩire Flood Protection. This add-on was made 
with the script DeÔøΩire in mind, but it can be used with other scripts.
This script contains protection from CTCP and msg "floods", and character 
floods. In the future I hope to add nick flood, text/action flood protection,
and  channel protection. To load up this script just type:
/load -rs <directory of the file>\flood.mrc (ie. /load -rs c:\mirc\flood.mrc)
*****************************************************************************
Updates: 10/11/97
1. Created CTCP flood protection for maximum/normal/minimum levels
2. Created MSG flood protection for maximum/normal/minimum levels
3. Created Online help

10/29/97

3. Added  the if op to the kick for character flood.
