Phantom Apocalypse Fserv and MP3 Offerer
by Andi 
email: Phantom4@pacbell.net

This is a basic MP3 Server addon for mIRC.  It will allow you
to advertise MP3's on a specefied channel and also allow you
to operate an fserv with MP3's or other files. (note- the fserv
will not work with files that have extensions larger than 3 
characters) Users may receive files from you through the Fserv
or through the use of a trigger sent to the channel of your
choice.

I made this for fun, and am offering it to anyone else who would
to try it out.  It may not be the fanciest of MP3 server scripts,
but it gets the job done.  There is just one bug I am currently
aware of: 1) At the very end of setup, if you are currently connected 
to irc, it will give you 5: ÔøΩHN Unknown command If you are not 
connected you will receive a message: *** Not connected to server, 
please ignore these. You will not see these again, unless you reload 
the script and run setup again. This is the only bug I know of, 
If you find a bug please email me a description with Phantom Bug 
as the email subject.

To install, unzip the contents of phantom.zip into your mIRC directory.
Do not unzip into any other directory, and do not move any of the files
into a different directory.
Then type: /load -rs setup.mrc
When mIRC asks you if you want to run initialization commands, click on yes.
Setup will work the same wether you are connected to IRC or not, so I
suggest you load this offline.
During setup, information will be sent to the status window about
the current function that is being set.

Note: filenames should not have spaces in them so it your have something named:
group name song name.mp3
it should be named to:
group_name-song_name.mp3
