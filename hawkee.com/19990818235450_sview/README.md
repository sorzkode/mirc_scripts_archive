Installaiton
������������
First make you sure you have the following files: 
-sview.txt     : this file
-sview.mrc     : main script
-sview2.mrc    : second part of main script
-sview.bmp     : titlebar icon
-sview2.bmp    : status bar icon
-mail.bmp      : mail icon

Copy those files into you mIRC directory or to any
other place and include this text file. 

Now in any window type: /load -rs location\sview.mrc

sview2.mrc will automatically be loaded aswell as pjuke.mrc
See Status,Channel and Menubar popups or type: /sview to start.

About
�����
The reason why I made Script View is so that I can have quick access
to a script in full colour. Script View can also be used to view any 
other file, search through it and lots more! Try it. You'll also see 
that I make it quite clear that the windows is part of EAE's RR-GUI 
2.0 script. Thats cause I really like his work and it looks neat. 
Goto www.eae.net/rr to get RR-Gui 3.0!

Oh, and .. no the titlebar is not suppose to like that of win98. I 
reversed it - I thought it looked good enough. 

*NOTE:If you have a huge amount of *.mrc files in your mIRC directory
      (including subdirs) SView might take a while depending on various
      things

Bugs
����
The only bug I know of is that sometimes the Script View window does
not want to minimize. It seems that this only happens when your Status
Window is minimized.
I tested Script View many times in different conditions to
try and make sure you dont have any probems.
If you have a problem or find a bug please let me know at: 
hlessing@iafrica.com.

Find me on Dalnet
