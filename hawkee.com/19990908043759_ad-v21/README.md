<>  III.  How to use this addon  <>

This addon has many options.  From the Main menu these are your following options:

1.  Addon Description 	- Lets you view a Description of the addon you selected
			(Option only works if the Addon is AD compatible, you
			can make the addon AD compatible by simply right
			clicking in the @Addon Description window and chosing
			make AD compatible.  Give it TITLE, AUTHOR Name, and
			Description.)  This option lets you get a quick idea
			of what the Addon is for.

2.  Directory Options 	- From here you can see what the current addon directory
			is for Addon Detection.  You can open that directory
			or change it to a new one.  You can delete all the files

			directory to a new addon directory.

			files.

4.  Window Options	- Allows you to turn the window timer on and off and to
			change the delay that is on the timer (The timer is to check
			the addon directory every so many seconds to see if any new
			files have been copied to it).  You can minimize the window
			or maximize the window.  Also you can save the window position
			to your likings or reset it to the default that I chose.

5.  Hidden Addons	- Allows you to see the Hidden Addons and gives you the
			option to Unhide them.
