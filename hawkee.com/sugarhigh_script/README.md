3.About the script







1.Installing



Start by moving all files into your mIRC directory.

Open up mIRC 4.7, usually located in the c:/mirc directory, although

i'd sure hope to God that you'd already know that.  Go to the Menu

Bar and click on "Tools".  Drag down to "Aliases" and click on it.

A window will pop-up.  Click on the "Load..." button.  Now find the

file "sugarhi.ini" and double click on it.  You have just installed

part of the script.  Next go to "Tools" again and drag down to "Popups".

Load the script the same way as before.  Next return to "Tools" one

last time.  Drag down to "Remote".  Load the same as before, only this

time you'll have to load each of the options.  So click on "Users", load

the script, then click on "Variables", load the script, then "Commands",

"Events", and finally "Raw". Once done, you are now using SuGaR HiGh.



2.Adding Users



Users are given certain abilities, depending on the number you give

them.  The higher the number, the more power they have.  Of course, you

get to have the highest number.  So go to "Tools" located on the menu

bar, drag down to "Remote" and then click on "Users".  This window is

empty now, but you can fill it with as many people as you want by

following the rules as follows.  The only reason you should add yourself

is so the script protects you.  Otherwise, you don't even need to if

you feel that it's a little complicated.  Anyway, you add users to the

user list in this form:

#:*!*user@*host.com

The spot with the # sign will be replaced with a number depending on the

level of the person you wish to give them.  You should be able to

figure out the rest of that line.  If not, then ask in a channel and

most everyone will be able to answer you.

Here are the different numbers and what power they have.  There are only

a few needed for this script:



1: Default number.  You don't need to add this to anyone.

7: Protected user.  When one of these users is banned, the script will

    help them.

8: Auto-op user.  When one of these users joins a channel which you have

    ops in, you give them ops.



3. About the Script



SuGaR HiGh was finished on April 8th, 1997.  It was made by ShapeShifter.

Visit my web page at http://www.efn.org/~phelps.  All aspects of the

script are originally written by the author and not copied from any

other script.  People who helped along the way are LORDacid (aka Smily),

NightStriker, NevrMore, and Speedy13.  All of us reside on Afternet,

IRC server address agora.rdrop.com.  Thanks a million for supporting me.
