Known Bugs
Send/Check/Delete may not work with some mail servers due to syntax's.

Getting Started
All you have to do is extract the files to your main irc directory and then in irc type:
 /load -rs makmail.mrc
Click yes to running the initialization commands.

Email Logs
This allows you to log the email addresses of people so you can remember them later.  Only one address per name is allowed.  Email Addresses will bring up a control window where you can view and edit all the names and addresses.

Send Mail
Mail Server for sending mail is SMTP on port 25.  The mail server is usually mail.provider.com, for example, my provider is direct.ca and my mail server is mail.direct.ca. You don't have to use the mail server of your provider but it will most likely be faster. Enter in the information when asked and a mail window will open.  Enter in your message, when you close the window the message will send.  To cancel you must use the popups.

Check Mail
Mail server for sending mail is POP3 on port 110.  In order to check your mail you must enter in your mail server, username, and password.  You can enter in this information under mailboxes so you don't have to keep re-entering information.  After logging in your can read, save, delete or reply to the messages.

Mail Bomb
Mail bomb was removed from this version.

Delete Bomb
If somebody mail bombs you, you can use this to quickly delete all of the emails.  Just enter in the mail server, user name and password or use the information from a set mailbox.
  
Mass Mail
Before you can use this you need to configure the addresses in the mailto.txt.  All addresses must be on a seperate line.  Spaces will be considered addresses and will result in a mail error.  After configuring the list, click on mass mail, enter in the mail message and it will begin sending.

Popup Menu
This will open the same window that was opened on startup.  You can check or uncheck the menu's where you want the email system popups in.
