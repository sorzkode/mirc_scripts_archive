BuggyMan FileStats ver 1.0

Grand Opening of BuggyMan mIRC addons! (hehe)

1.1

- Major update. Made f7 the activation instead of f3 and did a MAJOR
renovation of the graphics.

1.2

- Made a reset button for convenience

1.3

- ReMade the reset button due to the fact it was ugly.

- Made a window detection scheme so that pressing f7 too many times
wouldn't send the window into the depths of mIRC! ;)

1.4

- Remodeled the main window

- Added a Past File reader that will show you all of your
past downloads. ( just click on download or upload to scroll
through the files )

1.5

- Fixed a major bug that crashed mIRC when you reset
the file browsing window

1.6

- Mega change to the file browser.. really nice looking
window ;P I might eventually do this for the main
window but not now ;)

1.7

- Ultra Mega Change! Whole system has been made into
*.bmp's (which makes it about 100k bigger but I think
the nice look is worth it)
