             Megapede v1.01 for mIRC 5.31
            by Hawkee (hawkee@hawkee.com)

	This was a somewhat tricky script to write 
because of the speed limitations in mIRC.  It took me 
about 3 or 4 rewrites to make it operate at the speed
it does now, but this is still not as fast as a normal
windows application.  I would recommend you use at least
a Pentium 133 with this script.  It's been tested on a
Pentium 200 and operates the best with a system of this
speed with a clear variable list.

	The object of the game is to move your little
ship (looks like an upside down V) around with the mouse
and shoot at the Megapede which is coming down on you 
from the top.  If he reaches you, you die and have to 
start the level over again.  If you bump into a bush or
accidentally hit your own shots, you will die as well.
The object is to pass all 5 levels.  Each level, the
megapede will get slightly faster, and you will have 
more trees in your way.

	I didn't put many options in this game because
I wanted it to be as simple to use as possible, but if 
you right click on the game play screen, you may choose
to reset your game and start from level one, pause the 
game or display the frames per second.  If it is running
slow, you might want to check your frames per second.
A good speed would be anywhere from 15 to 20.  If you're
running less than 10 FPS, your computer might be too 
slow to handle all of the game's processing.  One way 
to speed this up somewhat is to clear out all of your
variables, but be careful not to clear anything 
important.

	This may not be the most enjoyable game, but
it does show off what can be done with a mIRC picture 
window, and I hope this can be used as a basis for 
future scripting ideas.  I would like to see more 
innovative scripts like this, so please feel free to 
study some of the techniques I used throughout Megapede.

Installation:

- Unzip the megapede.mrc file to any directory you wish, 
most likely your mIRC directory.

- Inside mIRC type this from any editbox:

	/load -rs c:\path\to\megapede.mrc

  or if you unzipped it to your mIRC directory, try:

	/load -rs megapede.mrc

- Type /megapede and enjoy


Versions:

March 14, 1998 - v1.01

- Cleaned up Megapede refresh; much more fluid movement.

March 9, 1998 - v1.0

- First public release.
