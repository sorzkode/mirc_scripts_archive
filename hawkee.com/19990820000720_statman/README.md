the .mrc file.
If you unzip it to d:\internet\mirc\statman\ - then from mIRC you would
type:
	/load -rs d:\internet\mirc\statman\statman.mrc
or, if you unzipped it to: c:\mirc\statman\ then you would use:
	/load -rs c:\mirc\statman\statman.mrc

For any additional help, type /smhelp after the script is loaded, or
