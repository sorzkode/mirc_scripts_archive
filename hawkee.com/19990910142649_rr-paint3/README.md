------------
What's that?
------------

   RR-Paint 3.0 is a paint program, much
like paintbrush, with the ability to connect to other users
of the script and draw a picture with them.

------------
Requirements
------------
   
   RR-Paint is a script written for mIRC 5.31 only (Higher 
versions might work, though). 
   16bbp colors and above are highly recommended (RGB).

-----
Usage
-----

To install:

   1. Unzip the file RR-paint3.zip, to your mIRC directory 
      preferred.
   2. Open mIRC.
   3. From the command line on any window, type:

	/load -rs c:\mirc\RR-paint.mrc

      Replace the c:\mirc with the path to the unzipped 
      files.

   4. When mIRC asks whether to perform the script's automatic 
      commands, answer 'Yes'.

To activate:

   * Type in the command line from any window:

	/Paint

   * You can also activate it from the menubar (Paint).
