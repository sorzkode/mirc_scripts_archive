| intro
'----------- -  -   -
ok,  welcome to my lil away system.  this is probably the most advanced away
system to date, or the only gui system for mirc 5.4, hehe. almost everything
in the  script is self-explanatory,  but those that aren't will be explained
in this file, i guess. anyways, read on, enjoy the sucky script. buyaka, !%@

,-
| install
'----------- -  -   -
first off, place the file "away.mrc" in or near your mIRC 5.4+ directory. if
it isn't already,  open the mIRC in that directory.  then in any window with
an editbox, type /load -rs away.mrc and hit enter. make sure you click "yes"
when it asks you to perform the script's startup.  the rest is automated. :)

,-
| running
'----------- -  -   -
when you load it,  it will popup a window that lets you select where you put
the popups. you can click as many as you like, or none at all. this is where
the popups will be for when you right-click in a window,  so its a good idea
to pick one.  if you don't pick any,  you can always use typed out commands.

,-
| commands
'----------- -  -   -
this section will show you a list of commands that can be used in the script

  /away.mrc
    this opens the main window in where you can change/edit all the settings
    of the script. this is the core of the script. simply point and click on
    the area to change. keep in mind, checkmark = on, blank = off.  when you
    check one,  it isn't turned on until you click save, that way if you hit
    close, it will cancel and not save any changes.

  /away.mrc.popup
    pops up a window that lets you choose where the popups of the script are
    going to be placed.
  
  /away.mrc.credit
    this opens a window that shows various info and tells who helped me beta
    test the script. also a small amount of greetings =P
  
  /away.mrc.unload
    unloads the script but leaves the message log and script files
  
  /setaway [reason]
    this will set yourself away. if [reason] isn't specified,  it will use a
    default reason.
  
  /setback
    this will set yourself back from being away. when you set yourself back,
    if you've recieved messages, it will tell you how many.
  
  /view.log
    this will show your current logged messages in a seperate window.  there
    you can choose to SAVE or DEL the log, respectively.
  
  /rem.log
    this will delete all your current logged messages.

| bugs
'----------- -  -   -

know by emailing me at wabbit69@earthlink.net or memo me on dalnet or msg me
on #addons@efnet. ps: if it gpf's on you its mirc 5.4. still buggy khaled!$^

uhm, like yah. i made this script to show everyone i can script gui!$@  this
is for everyone who said i couldn't. and for my love Caylah, who i thank for
not holding a grudge. ;) so everyone who still thinks i can't script gui for
shit, can suck one. because i just proved i can, you ignorant, insignificant
self-opinionated bastards!$@#% :P thanks all, you pushed me to make this. =P
