2) Allows you to select which of the three most common ports to monitor

3) Optionally attempt to find attacker on IRC

4) Can log attack into a file for later review

5) Play a sound to alert your when you're attacked


-- Installation --

1) Move all files from ooblock.zip (See File List below) into your mIRC directory or a subdirectory of it.

2) Run mIRC

3) Type the command exactly as follows /load -rs [path\]ooblock.mrc  *Note* in place of [path\] type the path of the ooblock.mrc file in relation to the mIRC directory.

4) When prompted to run initiation commands, press Yes

-- File List --

1) checked.bmp

2) ooblock.bmp

3) OOBlock.ini

4) ooblock.mrc

5) Readme.txt


-- General Usage Notes --

1) If you close the OOBlock window, press F10 to make it reappear.

2) Ports 139, 138, and 137 are the most often hit by OOB attacks.  Port 139 is used in the vast majority of attacks, but recently 138 and 137 have been getting hit.

3) If constantly encounter problems with the ports being open, check to see if you are running any other monitoring software (ie. a Port Listener)

4) Some patches and fixes for OOB attacks will negate the protection offered by this software.

5) OOBlock can only provide protection while mIRC is running.

6) When you reposition the OOBlock window, it will open to that position.  If you wish for it to be centered once more, open OOBlock.ini and delete the entries called X and Y under the OOBWin heading.  Shut the window and then press F10.
