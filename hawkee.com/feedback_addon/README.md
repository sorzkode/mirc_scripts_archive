Feedback/Comments Add-On -- by [SB]Tikiman

Here is a basic, straightforward example of a simple feedback feature.  What it will do is prompt for a E-
Mail address and a comment, then connect to a SMTP server and send the comment to you, the author of 
the script.  Now keep in mind that this will allow people to mail bomb you very easy -- if you donÔøΩt trust 
your script users, then maybe you shouldnÔøΩt use this.  

Directions --

1. Change the "your.e-mail@your.domain.com" to your e-mail address.
2. I have chosen a SMTP server at Creighton University, but there is no guarantee this will always work.  I 
suggest you use one that is closer to you, preferably within your own domain.  Usually you kind find one by 
telnetting to port 25 on a Unix machine, then use /dns to get the ip address.  If you have no idea what I am 
talking about, then try to make do and/or learn Unix basics.
3. Run the alias "/comments".  Put it in a popup or something.  Or have it run the second time the script is 
used.  Be creative.  This alias will prompt for an E-Mail address and for a comment, and then connect to the 
mail server and send you the mail.  It will also time-out after 30 seconds, you can adjust this vaule in the 
"timer222" command.
4. Test it a few times -- I usually have DCC chat "Auto-accept and minimize" on so as not to burden the 
script user with more choices.  When it works properly, the user wont even see an open window -- very 
nice.  But how you protect yourself from unwanted DCC chats is up to you.
5. Questions, comments?  E-Mail to bkennedy@haverford.edu

ThatÔøΩs it -- check out my script "LinkBot" at http://www.students.haverford.edu/bkennedy/linkbot.zip
