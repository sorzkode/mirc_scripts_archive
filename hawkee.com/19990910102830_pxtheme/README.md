2. Type /load -rs c:\path\to\pxtheme202\pxtheme202.mrc at the mIRC
   command line.

-----[ Description ]--------------------------------------------

ProjectX Theme Manager is one of the best, and probably the
first, complete theme managers for mIRC, that is an addon,
rather than an entire script.

Two themes are included, but more will come soon, and if you
want to make your own, go right ahead! :)


-----[ Updates ]------------------------------------------------

This is a minor bugfix.  Since the last version, the following
have been changed:

1. when you /msg someone, and there is no query window with them
   opened, you will see [(msg)nick] text] rather than nothing.
2. several small bugfixes, updates, and more testing.

shouts go out to MEM0 for support and ideas.  also to the rest
of the ProjectX crew for putting up with my testing ;)


-----[ ProjectX ]-----------------------------------------------

ProjectX is a Scripters Crew that focuses on creating scripts,
mainly mIRC-scripts. Not just one kind of script but all-kinds.
We create Practical Scripts for the lazy IRC-user, Protection
Scripts for the threatend one, Warscripts for the aggressive or
vengeance-seeking among us.

We are an organised group of scripters determined to help each
other create, develop and refine scripts. We bundle our 
knowledge, so that the inexperienced scripters may benefit from
our experienced crew-members and our experienced crew-members
benefit from the enthousiasm and fresh insights from our
less-experienced members. We are not trying to create the
'ULTIMATE' script, there is no such thing. We concentrate on
creating good, reliable, compatible and useful scripts for mIRC
users.

- Visit our homepage..: http://www.projectx.princess.dk/
- Vist us on IRC......: #projectx (Galaxynet)
