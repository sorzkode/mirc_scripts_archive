This script was created to search popular IRC

networks for a particular user or a number of users.

I have worked on this for about a month and I think

i have gone over every error I could encounter.

There are a few errors that you may encounter and you 

can look up the problems below.  If you cant find a sollution

e-mail me at: CoNfUsEd@CyberClan.com



!!FIRST!!

load the ini file:confusedsearch.ini in remotes.

Type: /search to begin



keep all these files in the same directory!





This script searches the following networks:

Efnet 

Dalnet

Undernet

Newnet

more servers to be added later.



Possible errors:



Q: Why am i getting a bunch of errors like DRAWTEXT Unknown command?

A: You are not using mIRC 5.31 or higher!



Q: Why is it that I cant find anybody and the search takes forever?

A: Maybe you're not connected to the internet? or using a firewall? or 

have a slow modem, or no person matches the search string you supplied to

the script. 



Q: I can't find my friend dammit, what is wrong?

A: Are you typing the persons name right and/or

using wildcards like "*" or "?"



Q: Yes I am using wildcards and I still cant find them,

what is wrong with this damn thing?

A: Is your friend +I (invisible)?

or on one of the IRC networks that i have listed above?

maybe he/she is on a split server or not connected 

at all.



Q: My computer slows down and mirc freezes,

whats it doing that for?

A: maybe you did a search for an address that matched 

thousands of users, just wait until its done.



Q:Why isnt the little blue bar moving?

A: Because it is either collecting information or

its waiting for information.



How this works:

Well i created the picture window making it look 

like the Win95 search program.  It took a basic 

knowledge of picture windows, socket commands, mirc,

and basic geometry to create this.



Here is the procedure:

I connect to a bunch of IRC networks using hidden

sockets.  I do a /who "Person/Address".

I collect all the information.

when i recieve the "end of /who" raw numeric I

disconnect from the network.

Then you click the results button and see your 

search results.
```
