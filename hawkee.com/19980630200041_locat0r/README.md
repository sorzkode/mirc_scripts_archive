 Requirements:

 mIRC 5.3
 Due to the advanced features that Locat0r uses, it
 WILL NOT work on any mIRC lower than version 5.3.

 #####################################################

 Installation:

 Unzip into your main mIRC directory.  You should have
 a folder called "locat0r\" in your main mIRC
 directory which will contain a bunch of files that
 are needed by Locat0r to run properly.  Now, in mIRC,
 type this:

 /load -rs locat0r\locat0r.mrc

 Then type /locat0r to run the game.  Enjoy.

 #####################################################

 Notes:

 The "uncovering-blank-space routine" isn't like the
 real Minesweeper's.  It's more challenging this way.

 The grid size is unchangeable.  (I have to leave
 something for the next version... right?)
