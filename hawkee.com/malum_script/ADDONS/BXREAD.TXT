bX-eMU v1.9.9 by f0k
This is the readme.  yeah.
If you are a total idiot/newbie/prick/7th Sphere user dont use
this script.  If you are inclined to msg me every other day asking
me how to use this script, dont use this script.

Use Terminal Font
Use a Black BackGround

If these two changes fuck up the way your normal script looks.  I
sudgest you discontinue using your "normal script" and just use
bx.mrc  (write your own damn flood prot or wait for 2.0)

Dont use this Script over top Évë® §¢®ipT by Limbeck777.  For that
matter, dont use this script over top any script written by a DALNet'er
DALNet originated for faggots with no fucking balls... you under-
stand what Im saying?  If you are a DALNet'er and are offended by
this, FUCK YOU JEW BOY! (Im jewish so i can call ppl jews if i want,
uhh, yeah =])

Version 2.0+ of this script will rock you.  I promise.  I plan to
add /cdd functions, /dcc things, more on EVENT things.  Will add
bX's userlist too.  If I like the look, I will go to /window.  No
promises on that one though.

and yes, I am aware that myn (myname) made a bX emu.  But that was for
mIRC 4.72.  This, my friends, owns mynames bX emu.  Altho, if you
need a good script, try Millenium by myname, it r0x.

If you use !so!, Id like to congradulate you on yer good taste.
Now, unload bx.mrc  static orange users do not need this script.

My script will be done soon.  I promise.  At this point in time it
has no name.  When my script is done, I will put up a webpage with
my script and all my addons.  Later
