  5. Notes from the creators


  1. Welcome New MaLum users!! MaLum is an all around script with many great
  features including: A portscanner, encoder, e-mail checker, server 
  list, /longtext, fserve, /mhelp, and much much more! I recomend you use 
  the /mhelp, it is a great help to new users. When you start MaLum 
  everything should already be loaded in aliases, popups, and remote.  If 
  not go to section #3,Loading MaLum. If you need further help you can 
  contact me(KRAkeR) and/or PyroMan in #MaLum on the undernet weekdays from
  3:00pm to around 10:00pm (usually) and on Friday - Saturday you can find
  us in #botz from around 2:00pm to 6:00am Saturday.   


  2. WELCOME BACK previous MaLum users! MaLum 7.2 has many changes and 
  updates. One big change is that MaLum doesn't use .ini's in the aliases, 
  popups, or remote anymore. It is now .mal's because of you can now store
  unlimited things in each file. You don't need popups.ini, aliases.ini, 
  aliases2.ini, talkers.ini, remote.ini, raw.ini, ctcps.ini, events.ini
  and events2.ini. If you still have those in your directory and you
  should delete them. DO NOT delete any other .ini's other than the 
  ones listed above!!! There are a few other new features in MaLum such as 
  /mhelp, cool msg, screwban, more servers to server list, bug fixes,
  new help file, a nice little comment sender, and much much more...
  For more read versions.txt. If you need further help you can contact 
  me(KRAkeR) and/or PyroMan in #MaLum on the undernet weekdays from 3:00pm 
  to around 10:00pm (usually). PLEASE read MaLum.hlp,versions.txt or 
  mIRC.hlp before you contact us about problems, we are very busy most of 
  the time and do not have time to answer your questions. Although we 
  might have some free time it'd just be better for you to read through
  any of those files I just stated BEFORE coming to us!

  4. Squashing those bugs and problems  
 
     Ok I'm only gonna say this once. If you find any bugs then you can email
     them to masterj97@aol.com and tell him EXACTLY what the bug is and where
     to find it. If you find you're having problems using the script then 
     please refer to the /mhelp or MaLum.hlp file included. We do not have
     the time to answer your questions because we are very busy most of the
     time. Although we might not be busy just refer to this files BEFORE 
     emailing us or talking to us. 


  5. Notes from the creators

             Good news! The email bomber,comment sender, and the regular 
             emailer now work so have fun! I think this version of 
             MaLum is TOTALLY bug free! If it isn't then fuck me up
             the arse because I thought I squashed all uv da bugs!
             There was a beta copy of MaLum 8.0 that I happend to
             give out to _Five_ and I forgot to give it to KRAkeR
             first. _Five_ is you're reading this then erase YOUR 
             MaLum 8.0 copy and replace it with this one because
             your colors are screwed up! Peace out peeps!

             In the last version of MaLum we added a new help file
             (malum.hlp)We added this so the user could better understand
             MaLum and so you would not have to come to us to ask us
             all these questions. So please refer to the malum.hlp
             before asking us any questions.

             In the last few versions of MaLum we have been adding a
             lot of new stuff, and we are running out of ideas. So if
             you have a GOOD idea then come to #MaLum and tell us.
             Don't waste our time with lame ideas!!

                                -KRAkeR-
