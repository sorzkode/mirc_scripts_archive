MaLum 7.2 updates |
-------------------

Total updates: [15]

1. Fixed $size identifier not working in mDCC (?)
2. In chanstats where it says "IRCops: none" it doesn't show none
   now it just shows a regular percent like all the others and it 
   also won't show the ircop nicks either!
3. Fixed ON DNS
4. /search doesn't use $rainbow now
5. Added color to finger.txt! (/finger <your nick>)
6. Changed some of the colors around
7. If you try changing your nick to something that someone's already using it
   will show something like "PyroMan is already in use by ~nutcase@wallycom.com"
   (That's just an example)
8. You can now choose wether to autoop someone on * or just 1 channel.
   (Still in testing stages so it may not work sometimes)
9. Finally fixed /email,/emailbomber, and the comment sender!!!!
10. When you start up for the first time it brings up readme.txt,versions.txt
    and the malum.hlp file! (Why so many files you ask? I decided to 
    put them to use since nobody was using 'em!)
11. When you set away you can now choose wether or not to have the pager
    ON or OFF. (Plus the away msg looks a lil better tew)
12. Added an "input logger" which logs everything you type in ...
    You can turn it off or on in the settings or new.setting
13. When using mDCC a user can now retrieve the description of a certain
    packet number by /notice <your nick> desc #<packet number>. This
    will add that user's $site to ignore for 15 seconds to make sure
    that user doesn't flood you off. 
14. Added a "typer" which types the text you specify to yourself ...
    Well sorta like a type writer.
15. Fixed bug in fserve that was allowing people infinite credits 
    (I had forgotten a halt in a certain spot)
16. Added $newdate(character) identifier
