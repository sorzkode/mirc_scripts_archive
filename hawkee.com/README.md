# Hawkee.com Scripts Archive

## üåê Preserving the Largest mIRC Script Database

This folder contains scripts archived from [**Hawkee.com**](https://sorzkode.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hawkee.com), which was one of the most comprehensive and popular mIRC script databases during the height of IRC culture. These scripts were recovered using the Internet Archive's CDX API, capturing content from the years **1996-2008**.

## üîç Archive Methodology

### Data Collection Process

This archive was created using the Internet Archive's CDX (Canonical URL and Timestamp) API

### Recovery Details

- **Source**: Internet Archive Wayback Machine
- **Time Range**: 1996-2008
- **Method**: Automated scraping via CDX API
- **Coverage**: Partial - depends on Internet Archive crawl frequency
- **Completeness**: Some scripts may be missing due to archival gaps

### Technical Limitations

- **Snapshot Dependency**: Only URLs captured by Internet Archive are available
- **Temporal Gaps**: Some periods may have limited or no coverage
- **Metadata Loss**: Correlating the .zip files to the corresponding information pages for the scripts can be tricky - even with web scraping

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Organization

Each script in this archive follows the standard structure:

```
hawkee.com/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script_name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original_files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Specific Warnings for Hawkee Scripts

### Era-Specific Considerations

Scripts from this period may contain:

- **Outdated Security Practices**: Primitive or missing input validation
- **Network Exploitation Tools**: Port scanners, DoS utilities (educational only)
- **Email Integration**: SMTP bombers and bulk mailers (now illegal in many jurisdictions)
- **File System Access**: Direct file manipulation without modern safeguards
- **Registry Modifications**: Windows registry changes without user consent
- **Known viruses**: It was fairly common for scripts to contain trojans - if I find these, I will delete them
- **Nukers / flooders**: I will keep these files in place as I don't see them as harmful in modern day technology
- **Innapropriate / Offensive Language**: Shrugs
