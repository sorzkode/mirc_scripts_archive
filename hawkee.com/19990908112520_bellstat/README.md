� Read Me for: Belldandi's Text Action Text  �
� Made for: mIRC 5.1                        �
����������������������������������������������

Current Text Action Text Version: 1.35

Note:  All of this is typed into the text bar 
       no special command is needed. This is
       just strait text, no /me or anything
       else.

To Load: Place the bells-tat.ini in your mIRC directory and type these commands.

	/remote on
	/load -rs bells-tat.ini

 (For the file to load this way, the bells-tat.ini must be in the same directory as mIRC)

Usage:

Type 1 (Action->Text)  -  actions '' text

    Note: actions is what you are doing, text is what you say.
    Example: runs up to Tsubasa and says '' How are you today?

Type 2  (Text->Action) -  text ,, actions

    Note: Same as the above, only the text and actions are reversed.
    Example: Hi DrTofu.. how are you today? ,, shakes Tofu's hand


Remember: All these are used as plain text or /me (actions) nothing else.

Changes since version 1.3:
	1. Auto-Quote was added. (Can be found under Quotation then Normal Text)
	   This adds quotes to all text you say.
	2. An "Unload Script" was added.
	3. A few minor things were changed.

Changes since version 1.2:
	1. You can set *Anything* to the triggers now, the previous bug
	   in version 1.2 that prevented this is now eliminated.
	2. Quotation settings for the Text->Action
	3. /me now works with TextActionText.

Changes since verion 1.0:
	1. You can now set the "trigger" that sets off the script.
           (Trigger: The '' or ,, that tells the script what to do)
        2. The script will now sense if you added a period, comma,
	   exclamation point, or question mark after your action
	   in the Action->Text and will not add the comma.
	   (This is the Punctuation checker)
	3. It now adds quotation marks around the text in Text->Action
        4. All settings are accessed through the options bar at the top
	   of mIRC. (This is where "File" "Tools" "Dcc" are found)
