## 📋 Text Content (from gEnIuS/hElPbOt/ChanMode.txt)

```text
4Here is a list of the modes you can set for a channel

2*** +/-k = keyed

2    This means that the user must use a key to get into the channel. eg 

2    "/join #dragonrealm party"

2    usage: /mode <#channel> +k <key>

2*** +/-m = moderated

2    This means tha the channel is moderated.  One can only speak if he/she 

2    is an op OR if they have "voice"

2    To give a user "voice" (for ops), type "/mode <nickname> +v"

2    usage: /mode <#channel> +m

2*** +/-s = secret

2    That means that the channel will not show up on the channel list no 

2    matter how many users are in it

2    usage: /mode <#channel> +s

2*** +/-n = No outside messages

2    This means that you may only send to the channel if you are IN 

2    that channel.  Practically a must for channels.

2    usage: /mode <#channel> +m

2*** +/-i = invite only

2    This means that a person can only enter the channel when invited 

2    by someone else who is already in the channel.

2    usage: /mode <#channel> +i

2*** +/-l = limit

      This mode limits the number of users allowed in the channel at one time

      usage: /mode <#channel> +l <#>
```
