Installation and "Other" notes for =SaGa '97= v1.2



Installing:



1) RUN THE SAGA.EXE FILE.  IT WILL PLACE SAGA IN C:\SaGa.  (Run the exe to

   install like C:\, but it WILL put it in saga)

2) COPY THE mIRC32.EXE IN THE C:\SaGa DIR INTO THE \PROTECT SUBDIR

3) EDIT YOUR SETUP INFO

4) PLACE YOUR NICKSERV (optional) PW IN THE PW.NICKSERV.TXT FILE IN THE \UTILS DIR

5) You're done! - Now connect :)



Other notes: *PLEASE READ*



  =SaGa '97= v1.2 is unlike most scripts.  When your first boot it up

it will open two windows - One for your new status window, and the other

for ping replies.  DO NOT, DO NOT close these windows.  Notice how the

original status window is small? That's because you don't need it anymore.

A good thing is just hide it behind the channel window.  Make the ping

reply window just under half the screen wide, and the rest the new status

window.  A good height is 3 inches.  If you would like to see what I found

as the best configuration for these windows, look at SHOT1.GIF - It's a

screenshot of my window configuration, I belive you'll find it's the best

and easiest one.  If you DO close these windows, click the popup in the

real status window to get 'em back.



  For help on the script's commands, please check out CMDHELP.TXT - A list of

ALL saga's commands.  Print 'em out if you wish, it's not that big.



  SaGa also comes with a protection bot.  This is NOT supposed to be a complex

bot.  It's simply there as that extra client who will protect you.  If you're

there by yourself, and you get deopped, you're done.  With the bot there, you

won't be.  It's that easy.  We welcome you to add your own code into the bot.



  On a final notice, for the script lookin' pretty, if you change the font or

font size, you may need to adjust the lines in the remote raw that are simply

dashes, the ones that look like /echo %statwin 10----------------------

to match the length with the ---- SaGa '97 ------ lines on top in your Statwin



NOTE: Feel free to alter some minor coding to suit your needs, but DON'T be

a fucking dick.  DON'T change some coding and slap your name on this script.

Access Denied worked hard, and we don't feel like having our work stolen.
