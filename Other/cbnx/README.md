		Welcome user to cbN.X. For this complete script to work

		correctly you must install the script where the mirc.ini

		places it "c:\mirc\cbnx\" I am sure you are capable of 

		running it elsewhere with only minor options not working

		correctly. But to be on the safe side, just place it where 

		it should be. As I have still found alot of mirc users 

,ssSP7Sss,     still use those little war scripts. Of course we have

8888 8888     completely ignored the WAR aspect of mIRC because only 

8888 :		little children with shattered egos have to come on IRC

8888:		to mess around with other people.. If you do not like 

8888   8888	this, and just feel you have to have the war option.

`84$#%e888*`	Then go elsewhere. While you are getting kicked off server

		after server from being a child. Others will be laughing

		while there little ctcp protection blocks your incoming

*%$8		flood, while your sitting there flooding yourself offline...

8888

8888$&%888%	

$8888888	Please Note: This current version of cbN.X is beta, as well 

8888*&$888*	as the first release "version" There may be a few bugs that 

		we did not spot. But don't "quote" me on that. We are looking

		for BETA testers. So if you would like to apply for this, 

.%8    	simply send email to the email address listed below. As for 

%888888888%	this version. We had "0" beta testers. So this is why we had 

88&8   88$8	to release it being beta. But we would enjoy any feedback you 

8888   $888     might have on this script. Being bad, or good. Just be honest.

888%   8888		

8888   8888&		



		To find on when cbN.X is being updated, or going off beta.

8888    88*8	Simply hit the "ver check" option. This is found within 

 8%8%  8&88	"miscellaneous/ver check" on the channel remote/ or menubar  

  888%$88      remote. Also note that we have taken out any option that seemed 

  88&%*888      to was anouying to us "as in" the channel stats on join, ect... 

 888  8888	As well as other options you will find on other miscellanous

8%&$    $&%8	scripts I can be reached on IRC as pacifier on the EFnet, and

		undernet if you wish to get in contact with me. If you want to          

		put this on your WWW page, please feel free to do so.



   

		

		NOTE: I pacifier "AM not" the KKK guy on "DALnet" That is 

		just a guy that seemed to love my name so much he just had 

		to use it..	



		Enjoy!
