   PigScript 1.75 For MIRC 5.02 Note Pad ReadME.TXT

======================================================



PigScript is not a XDCC specialised bot or a channel bot

neither is it a war or protection script. It is what's

known as a general script. It is designed for the average

IRC user. It contains many features but most of these

features are not as complex as there specialised

equivalents. My script is designed for ease of use over

specialisation but it is perfectly suitable for the

intermediate and expert users too. My  philosophy is

why make IRC more complicated then it already is?



Some of the many features include...



Easy configuration for all PigScript features.

An advanced yet easy to use XDCC offering system that

can also show your package listing in a channel at a

regular interval.

Friends Access so your friends can be invited, opped or

voiced in channels even if you are currently away from your

computer.

An Advanced away system that will save those important messages

to disk until you decide to delete them. So in the event of a

system crash or power failure all messages and notices will

still be readable from your harddrive. A page option is also

included.

Popup windows with detailed information on all your settings

which are constantly refreshed. Customising PigScript for

yourself has always been easy, but now with these information

windows it has become so much easier!

Easy Menus for Eggdrop bots, Sloth bots, Nick Servers,

Memo Servers and Channel Servers. Regular uses of these bots

and servers will find these easy menus a great help.

Simple yet efficient flood and channel protection. Though

this is not a protection script or a channel bot we realise

you still need to be protected from those annoying kids with

war scripts.

Easy to understand menus so keeping yourself and your channels

organised does not involve deciphering three letter acronyms

that a lot of other scripts use for their menus.





* Requirements

  Any computer able to run mIRC 5.02 32bit.

  A mouse.

  

* Recommended Options

  Sound Card

  Graphics mode in 640*480 or higher



* 3 Easy Steps to Install PigScript

  

  1) Run the file PigScript175.EXE and

     follow the prompts.



  2) After you have installed the script copy

     the file MIRC32.EXE to the PigScript

     directory you created.



  3) Goto the PigScript directory and run

     mIRC 5.02 (MIRC32.EXE).



* Upgrading from PigScript 1.60 or 1.70



  If you are upgrading from PigScript 1.60 or 1.70

  I recommend that you install PigScript 1.75 to a new

  directory instead of over writing your older version

  (if your old PigScript is located in C:\PigScript

  maybe install your new PigScript to C:\PigScript175.)

  This way you can just copy your old user.ini (where

  your friends listings are located) to the new

  PigScript directory and keep those old settings.



* Final Notes

  This script has been designed for MIRC 5.02 ONLY.



  It's use with versions other then MIRC 5.02 WILL cause

  some problems during operation.



  PigScript now checks the MIRC version before connecting

  to a server. If you are not using the correct version

  an error message will appear in the status bar.
