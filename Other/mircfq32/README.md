This is the Windows WRITE version of the mIRC FAQ.



This FAQ attempts to answer the most frequently asked questions about the Winsock

 IRC client mIRC, developed by Khaled Mardam-Bey. You are allowed to provide and 

distribute the mIRC FAQ -as is- by or on any medium as long as you make it 

available for free. You are not allowed to change anything in the file or charge 

any amount of money for your services. If you want to copy only certain parts for 

whatever use, make sure to mention my name and the FAQ as the source of information 

with every single quote whenever you publish it.  1995 - 1997 Tjerk Vonck mirc@dds.nl

 

The mIRC FAQ is available is several formats :



mircfq32.zip - windows write format ; mircfq32.wri

mfaq32hp.zip - windows help format ; mircfaq.hlp
