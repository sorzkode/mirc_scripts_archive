## 📋 Text Content (from README.TXT)

```text
Thank you for downloading Get Bent by eich.  

This script is for protection and general chating, although it does 

have a few floods.  What I did was took a combination of scripts and fixed 

them added other things.  



To load Get Bent do this when you start up you mIRC version 4.52 or higher

just delete the original remote.ini aliases.ini and the popups.ini.  Replace with 

the ones included with gb1.zip,  Or just unzip into the mirc dir and over write 

your current files.  Make shure that you turn on the listening button in the remote 

section under commands, events, raw.   



You will only have to do that step once, so that mIRC knows where to 

get the info for the next time you load it.  Make shure you turn on

the listening button in the events, raw, controll.   New thing for mirc 4.7 type /rc (text) and 

it will put you letters in random colours.  Also I added a icmp bomber.



About everything is easy to understand in the script, but if you have any

problems E-mail me or stop by the #guns channel.   



My IRC nick is eich and I am on the #guns channel or #awpuke.  

e-mail me eich1@powernet.net 

or stop by the home page http://www.powernet.net/~eich1/

I have all the option in the script and more detaild info on the home page!
