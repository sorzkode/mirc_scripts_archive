                          19th January 1997



I made this little script cos I was bored one morning.



                            N - E - W - S



1) Script was made in mIRC 4.72 So i guess you would use it in either

   mIRC 4.7 or 4.72



2) Modify this script but don't stick lameass backdoors in it.



3) Script was made for the channel #warez-nz on Undernet which is

   the official New Zealand warez channel.



          I - N - S - T - A - L - L - A - T - I - O - N



1) Setup your username/ident/email and all that shit in the server

   popup menu.



2) Goto OPTIONS and change the IRC switches, etc, etc to your 

   specifications.



                      W - A - R - E - Z - NZ



1) Official New Zealand UNDERNET Warez channel #Warez-NZ
