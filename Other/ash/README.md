Welcome! This is my script! I hope you enjoy it,

although its now much, its just for the average

irc user to have some accesories to use! :)



TO LOAD:

All u have to do is unzip this file to C:\ash

or whatever u want to call it, copy a mirc.exe

into the folder, and wahla, click on the mirc.exe

and u will have it loaded and be on #mirc_scripts

before u know it! ;)



First i have to write this stupid disclaimer:

I take no responisbility what so ever to the

things that can be done with this script(that

ain't much)



Heres the credits:

WireShock: For the aol scanner

Druglord: Mass Deop

Dead7: Just for being nice to me

Potholio: For teaching me how to use a fserve(although

there is no fserve in this script ;)



Well i guess that takes care of it! I hope u 

enjoy my script! I know its not much, but

i still hope u like it!



P.S. There will be other versions of

this script later on! :)
