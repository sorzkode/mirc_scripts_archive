---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.INSTALLATION and THINGS TO DO FIRST(BEFORE RUNNING mIRC)!!!



GO AND EDIT s_pie.ini and in_for.ini in /system directory

and change these------>>>>>>>



[mIRC]

email=CHANGE_ME!

nick=CHANGE_ME!

anick=CHANGE_ME!



to whatever you like.



fx.



email=calvin@hobbes.us

nick=I_SPY

anick=I_not_SPY



DO THAT IN BOTH *.ini Files and make sure that they DON'T have the same name!



If you installed this to another directory just change the c:\cefi\mirc32.exe

and the other directories with this format.

to---->>



c:\*\*\mirc32.exe where *'s are the names of the different directories.. 



That is all for *.ini edits. :)





If you want to run _/\Cefi/\_ and learn while playing... Go ahead..

If you want to read what you will experience go on....







----------------00000-----------------------00000-------------------------





2.What The F*** does this script do? (and have)



OK.. Here is where my comments on my script comes in.... 



-It is a fairly intermediate script which all people staring from 

semi-newbie can use.



-It has different flood preventation steps



-It has a Very useful spy bot called s_pie and In_former (ok 2 bots then)



-It doesn't have mass things because I personally don't like them



-It doesn't have flood thing because I don't like them too.



-I tried to use all` colours. If you are annoyed by colours.. Please 

don't use this script... After all colours make the difference. 

Anyway just give it a try...:)



-I used all the F keys...(Try them All!)

Which I think you will find it quite easy to use.



-Also for the popup freaks I added all the aliases to the popups.

So you can simply control everyting with popups.



-Also I have put some backdoors.. (Which I gathered from different scripts)

I'm not sure if they work... ( I didn't have the patience to test them all.. 

But the Ircle killer is quite fun)



-Also (man i use far to many also's :) There are funny quits.. etc. etc.



-I don't have undernet commands.. or some other net commands except Dal 

and Ice Net. That is because i never did try other any servers (seriously).



----------------00000-----------------------00000-------------------------



3.FOR THE BOTS...

Q-Why did i make a Spy bot?

A-Dunno I just Felt Like it.



You just run the bots.... enter the servers and channel names... presto... 

there you have a multi functional spy bot...

AND you don't have to go back to the other mIrc windows because you can 

control the bots from popups... Yes both of them...



What do they do?

They spie! :) hehehe

Basicly one bot which is reffered to as "s_pie_r" goes in the channel and 

says the things that happen in the channel to the other bot which is 

reffered as "In_Former" and "In_Former" says the thing to the channel that 

you are in.

The good thing about that is that since "s_pie_r" isn't in the same channel 

with you; so you can't be caught (except for the adress..Oh Well Nothing 

is perfect) Another thing is that you can connect "s_pie" to another 

server to spy on other servers.. f.x while you are on DALnet you can 

spy Undernet or some other net....



AND YES... They are colourful..



That's all from me at the moment... Have fun.. 



----------------00000-----------------------00000-------------------------



4.Bot Problem(s)?





IF YOU FACE BOT PROBLEM(S)..

n=13,n=15,n=32,n=37 in aliases is probably problem.



n13=  run $mircdir $+ mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ system\s_pie.ini 



n15=  run $mircdir $+ mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ system\in_for.ini 



n32=  run $mircdir $+ mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ system\s_pie.ini 



n37=  run $mircdir $+ mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ system\in_for.ini 



YOU SHOULD CHANGE THEM TO------>>>>>>



n13=  run C:\(your directory(s) )\mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ s_pie\s_pie.ini 

 

n15=  run C:\(your directory(s) )\mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ s_pie\in_for.ini 



n32=  run C:\(your directory(s) )\mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ s_pie\s_pie.ini 



n37=  run C:\(your directory(s) )\mirc32.exe $mircdir $+ s_pie\in_for.ini 







Credits....

Since I made this script on my own.. I guess most of the credits go to me.

Then again have to thank 'shel' for the Ah-crap!.wav hope you like it.



And thank you for patiently reading....



I don't think that you will experience bugs.. But then again who said i 

wrote the perfect script?



E-mail me @---> (---hg96307@nhs.dk---) for bugs and the things you would 

like to see on further versions.



Ps. I'm usually on DalNET as Renrical so you can find me there too. 



Now go and run _/\Cefi/\_
