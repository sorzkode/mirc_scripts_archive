## 📝 About This Collection

The "Other" folder represents a diverse collection of mIRC scripts gathered from various sources including personal archives, IRC channels, FTP servers, and websites that are no longer identifiable. These scripts span the late 1990s through the early 2000s and include a wide variety of bots, addons, themes, and utilities.

This collection is particularly valuable as it preserves scripts that might otherwise be lost to time, even when the original source is no longer known.
