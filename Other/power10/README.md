Released:  March 17th 1997





This script works great with mIRC 4.7 and above but is especially 

written for mIRC 4.72.



I have been working on this script for quite some time now and i hope

that everybody that is going to use this script will have lots of fun

with it.



There is hardly any war in this script but there is some. The only war

thats in this script are backdoors and revengeflood that will automatically

flood the person thats flooding you!. Big thanks for Smoke for that!!





HOW TO INSTALL.



Unzip the files to c:\power  IT HAS TO BE C:\POWER !!!



Make the following subdirectories: (optional) for all music and other 

files that will be sent to you by DCC. If you dont make any subdirectory

then the files will be copied to the c:\power directory



in

mid

wavs



Run mirc32.exe and fill in your nickname, alternate nickname, email addres

and your name and connect to an server.



Thats it





WHAT DOES THIS SCRIPT HAVE.

All the  +  +  will be explained below !!



DCC Protection. (Only your friends can dcc you !!)

you will automatically open any dcc chat or dcc send that will be sent 

to you by a friend. Someone that tries to dcc you but isnt in your 

userlist wont come trough. To change the auto accept go to dcc options

within mIRC itself.



CTCP Protection. (An excellent flood protection)

you will be echoed if a friend ctcp's you. A friend's echo will be in 

red. Someone else will be blue



Port 19 protection



Action flood protection  +  + 



Nick flood protection + Offensive nick Protection  +

Text flood protection  +  + 



Clone Detection. (the best)  + 



Visit counter for your channel 



Last seen recorder  + 

(only records your friends)



Personal Lag detector

(your lag and idle will be copied to your titlebar. Updated every min.)



Flash Flood Detector 



Private message flood protection 



An GREAT notify add-on

(Lets you know if your friends are on or not. Even if someone else is 

 using your friends nick. it will then notify you that it ISNT a friend)



Auto Ping 



Mail System



Auto send



Tsunami Protection



Serverop Protection 

(only works if you can recieve server notices. To enable or disable: click

status, and choose personal modes)



Split detector 



Ban detector 



Random color text. 

Just type /color <your text>  without the <>



Channel Stats



Missing server checking. 

WORKS ONLY FOR UNDERNET!!



Digital clock.



Idle Kick  +  + 



Counting all the CTCP's. 

Every CTCP that has been send to you will be counted. Every session you

have the counter starts at 0 but the total counter will not be reset when

you quit. To find out about these stats ALWAYS use the /bye command to 

quit mIRC !!!!



Voting booth.



XDCC.



And lots lots more.







To make the autosend work fill change the <yournickhere> to the nick that

you use all the time without the <>





To add a friend go to the popups menu and choose adding people.

Friends will get level 100 and will be exempt from triggering protections.

If you are an OP on a channel then and people are allowed to have ops

too then you HAVE to add them to your opslist. They will be exempt too

ofcourse and WONT be deopped when someone else ops them.



  = Some of these features are either ON or OFF and if you want to 

     enable or disable them then go to the popups in your status screen.



 = These features WONT respond to the people that you have put in your

     friends or opslist. 



PS The friends and opslist work with addresses AND email addies so if your

   friend or op change their emailaddy or connects with an IP number

   then you have to add him again. DO NOT REMOVE THE OTHER ONE.



 = These features will only work when you have ops!!



If you have found bugs then please let me know.

You can find me on #cyberworld on Undernet. Look for Ruffneck.



Special thanks to Smoke, ReVpOwER, 7th Sphere, Insanity, Baz`oo`ka and 

ALL the people that isnt in this list. They gave me the ideas to make

all the features in the script. Thanks to you all!!!

 



I HOLD NO RESPONSIBILITIES IF THIS SCRIPT GETS YOU K-LINED OR G-LINED.

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!
