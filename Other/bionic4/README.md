         ---=== BINIC v0.4 by Tenser (c) 1997 ===---

	         ---=== c/o ArSoN inc. ===---



Intro-

	This is pretty much just a clone of what2do.txt with a little more

  info on the script.  This version, I've fixed alot of stuff! I got rid of

  lots and lots of bugs that were in v0.3 (if anyone even d/led it, then

  they would know there were bugs! It was in it's beta stage when it was

  released). I didn't add much, but i fixed lots. See added.txt to see

  what i did...



Installation-

	Installation of BINIC v0.4 is really quite simple.  Create a

  directory called c:\bionic\ and put bionic.zip in there. Unzip it and put

  mirc.exe in there. Run INSTALL.BAT. Thats it! This script needs mIRC v4.7!

  If you don't have that, you can't use it. It also has to be the 16Bit 

  version for the clones to work right. I guess you could go through the 

  script and change all the mirc*.exe's to mirc32.exe's but that might take

  a while. OH YA! You MUST put bionic.zip in c:\bionic\fserve\scripts\ for

  the script to work right!!!!!!



Thanx-

	There's quite a few people I'd like to thank. Event though some of

  them didn't do much to help out with the script, I'd still like to thank

  them for getting me into mIRC scripting. Here they are:



	Khaled  - Creator of mIRC (the BEST IRC client!)

	TiAMaT  - Creator of TSG (The Scripters Guild; really cool!)

	Fugi    - Some hipcat on the dalnet

	GMS inc. - My lil scripting group (good mirc scripts) :]

	BioBlood - Made Hyperion (cool script)

	pure`   - Maker of Spite (one of the best scripts out there!)



That's about it...
