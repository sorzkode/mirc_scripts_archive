Thanks for taking the time to have a look at my script!



If you like anything you are most welcome to pinch it for your

own script, except for the channel scanners, they're B_Jai's

(hallmail@ihug.co.nz) - you should ask her before ya nick those.





To start, make a backup of your mirc.ini and then just unzip

haunted.zip into your mIRC directory....well, you probably

already have since you're reading this. :)



Haunted Script '97 haunted.zip should contain these files:



 apu.wav

 connect.wav

 haunted.ini

 mirc.ini

 readme.1st

 uthere.wav

 woohoo.wav



To load the script easier, load haunted.ini into Aliases and

then type /loadscript - that will load the rest of it. Also,

if you are an op on a channel with a X/W bot you will need to

customize the login and logout aliases, but that shouldn't be

too hard. :)



There are things I have purposly not included such as clever

kicks, war stuff and fancy this and that because I don't think

that sort of thing is nessesary, after all IRC is a place for

chatting--communication, not scripting....or.. is it?



You can email me about the script at: hallmail@ihug.co.nz or 

alternatively at challenges@geocities.com. If there are future 

versions, they will be available at my sister's page:

http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~hallmail/mirc.html.





Have fun!
