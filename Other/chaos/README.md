Out come looks good!

Out come looks bad!

How the hell would I know that?

Could you repeat the question?

Of corse!

How could it not be?

Not a chance!

Don't count on it!

All sources point to no!

All sources point to yes!

Don't bet too much money on it!

Definetely!

Definetely not!

Not a chance on earth!

Your fucked!

You will be a pimp in a few years!(i will teach you the basics)

You will die in a few minutes.
