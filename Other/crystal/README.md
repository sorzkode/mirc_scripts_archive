Thank you for trying my Crystal Cove v1.0 Script for 

mIRC 4.7 and 4.72. To install this script create a directory

called Crystal and execute the self-extracting file in the

Crystal directory and copy mIRC32.exe or mIRC.exe file into

the Crystal directory then create an Icon on your desktop

in windows and run it. The IRCops commands havent been tested

Since i am not an IRCop. Just a channel founder who thought

this script might appeal to a few of you out there. Crystal

Cove has meny features. Here is a list of features that

i have put into this script.



1. A very unique feature which is a Kiddie kicker like 

no other. Its a smart kiddie kicker. It detects whether

someone joining the channel is occupying channels that

deal in child porno, animal pics, teen pics, preteen, and

more. It first sends a notice to the user to exit either

the "Sicko" channel or the channel you are occupying.

15 seconds later if the user is still in "Sicko" channels

it sends a second and different message. 45 seconds after

the first message is sent a 3rd and different from the

other 2 messages telling them its thier last warning 

to either leave the "Sicko" channel or leave the 

channel your on. If they dont comply it kicks and bans

them from the channel. (Limited to channel Ops).

If the user does comply and leaves the Sicko Channels

it send a 4th and differnet message welcoming them to the

channel. If they exit the "sicko" channels just to get 

you off their back and they rejoin the "sicko" channel 

whithin 65 seconds of the last message sent to them the

kicker resumes where it left off. But after the 65 second

time expires you will have to do a whois on them to engage

the kicker. If the user exits the channel your on the 

kicker recognizes this and stops sending them notices about

the channel thier on. Ive also added a popup command to

either have the kicker On or Off. Also the actions of 

the kicker will not be displayed until an unfortunat

"Sicko" is caught and kicked from the channel your on.

everything runs without you seeing it.



Special thanks goes to zero from mIRC_Scripts for all his 

help with me getting the kicker debugged. Thanks Dude



Drawbacks for the kicker are... It will only run in one

channel. Im still working on getting it to run Multiple

channels. 



2. I have included ALL the IRC commands for Dal Net

into the Menu Bar Popup menu. ChanServ, NickServ, MemoServ

and HelpServ commands. 



3. For thoes of you who like Kicks and Slaps ive also 

included a ton of them. All located in the NickNames list

Popup Menu.



4. Channel Takeovers for Renegade Ops and Sops is no longer

a problem. On the Menu Bar i have included out of channel

Aops ans Sop commands.



5. FTP addvertisements also included. In the Menu Bar

there is FTP setup commands to run an addvertisment for 

your FTP site. Also in the Channel Popups Menu you can

see your current setup for your FTP add.



6. Simple Sound setup and Play. Click on the Play sound

and then select the wav you want to play and it will

play it to that Channel. Also Personal Sound Play is

included in the NickNames List Popup Menu under Misc



7. Random color text and Block text with Random letter 

color. also Ascii random color text



8. Channel Scanning for Clones is from Hawkee's

Script. Also the Fserve I have included in this Script 

is Hawkee's 2.0 leecher proof fserve. I have talked to him

about useing his fserve script in with Crystal Cove and

he said it was kewl as long as i left the Hawkee stuff

labeled Hawkee. Thanks dude

Has said that there is a problem with running his script

with mIRC version 4.72 I have fixed this problem and it

will work with that version. 



There are other features that you will discover while

useing this script. I hope i have worked all the bugs 

of it. The majority of you will only want to use this 

script for the kicker but that is ok. I hope i have made

the popups and use of this script fairly easy to use.

I hope you enjoy it.





Bye useing this script you are certifying that I (Baron22)

am not lyable for any actions that you cause useing my

script.
