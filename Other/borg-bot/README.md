## 📋 Text Content (from README.TXT)

```text
I see you have downloaded my borg-bot.

First there is one thing you must do....

In users type:



150:Yournick



Then you can use the special "executioner" command

Just type !execute and he will change his nick.  Then

target somebody as though you would with borg-bot and 

type fire guns.  He will then randomly decide whether

to kick the person, ban the person, or do nothing.  To

get his regular commands type !BB.  Enjoy 



p.s. It is recommended that end.txt, hit.txt hits.txt 

assimi.txt are all placed into c:\mirc or you can go to

remote\events and retype all of the directorys to the 

directory they are in.
```
