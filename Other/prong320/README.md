***INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS***

This is probably the easiest thing for anyone to do:



1) THIS BOT MUST BE IN A DIRECTORY NAMED C:\PRONG or it will

not work properly.  Period. So make a directory called \prong

and create a subdirectory called "seen" under \prong.  You will then

have \prong and \prong\seen



2) Create a shortcut that runs: C:\PRONG\MIRC32.EXE C:\PRONG\PRONG.INI



3) Read cmds.txt and whatsnew.txt for further information.

Printing them is NOT a bad idea.



4) Go to town! From his window, click on your name then add yourself

as a master. Open Tools/Remote/Variables and set %main and %master as 

desired.  You're all set :)
