THe KiNG v1.0 by ^allen. For mIRC v 4.72



;hi i have 3 scripts tied in to one so far thet are

;betaflood, asytum, retro12 so i dont know what all works it should all work  

;so i dont no what i got double of so 

;These scripts protect against all floods I know of has some cool

;things. 

;

;If you are being flooded badly, hit the F12 key. This will engage

;ultra flood protection. Hitting the F12 key a second time will

;change your nickname to a random nickname. Each time after this you hit

;the F12 key, it will change your nickname to another random one. This is 

;one of the best methods to avoid a very bad flood. When ultra flood 

;protection is on, you will be ignoring all input from other users, except 

;for channel actions, notices and text.

;To disable emergency flood protection, and restore your original 

;nickname, hit the F11 key,

;

;If your mIRC or computer locks up, hit the "F11" key when you restart

;mIRC. This will clear the Ultra flood protection mask. If you feel you

;are still unwantingly ignoring users, when you are not being flooded,

;you may have to clear the ignore list manually. To do this, from the 

;main menu bar, click "Files", then "Setup" then the "Control" tab. Click

;on "Ignore". Delete all the entries.

;

;If you have any custom ctcp commands, you must put them inside the #floodctcp

;group, inside the brackets, right where the CoUrTjEsTeR version command is. 

;All must be in the form, if $parm1 == <ctcp command> <mIRC command>. If you

;do not add them like this, those ctcp commands will not be protected 

;against floods. Custom ctcp replies must go inside the #floodctcpreply group,

;inside the brackets, or they will not be protected against floods either.
