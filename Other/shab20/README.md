README FOR SHADESBOT 2.0



Before you go installing it please at least skim through this file



I will try and keep it short



!!!!

Ok shadesbot contains a leech proove fserver which is written by a freind

of mine called hawkee (he gave me permission to use it)



Also shadesbot 2.0 contains a lot of addins and stuff which most other

scriptz do not contain



the only reason why i have released this scriptz is becuase i first wrote

shadesbot as a script for myself

but a few people were asking me where they could get a copy so

i decided to release it.



After the success if the original version I decided the had to be a sequel

and now with the release of mirc 4.7 I finally had it just were I wanted it

and after a slight face lift and a lot of major changes it is now

what you see before you.



INSTALLATION

just make a tempory dir dont matter what it is called



and unzip shab20.zip to thier

and then just run the file named install.bat

and it will do the rest for you



HAve FuN :->
