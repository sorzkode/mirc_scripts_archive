 -=StarRBot v1.03=- by RonStarR



MAJOR Changes 

Fixed Intial setup because some of you do not like 

to read the readme.txt file gotcha ass now hehehehehe 

added Individual setup so you can make changes after bot has 

been started or whenever you choose to 

made IRCOP-bot commands all in one ini hell it will 

only work on your personal server anyway

restrctured commands in events for a smarter bot

took out ircwav

added some better help on commands that run from ReAcToR

added commands popup in ReAcToR that will run bot from dcc chat window

added wavplay bot kinda talks to you, and when it does shit like kicks

added nick-trac by poolshark & ducky

Clonehigh protection from DOT by residue





Since most of you don't like reading this text file I fixed bot

so you have to do setup and you will see because it will not work

until you do, so please follow these directions thank you 



SETUP

Hell I fixed so you have to do it or stalls and will not start!!!



if you want the Ircwav i added with the 1st version ya can get it 

off my webpage see bottom of page for address (url)





IMPORTANT

Do Not panic when you see bot sending anti-idle.txt file to 

unknown user this is my version of Anti-idle and it works the bot 

stayed connected without a ping time out for over 30 hours it

may have made it longer but my dialer disconnected ( Fukin Att )

Ah YeS for all who are as crazy as I am

this an IRCOP-BOT version this bot is for all you nuts with 

conferance room and wircserv, yes those neat little personal IRC servers

for win95 and NT Ya have to see it to believe, the start.txt for ircop-bot

is in the sub-folder (opertext) all ya have to do is replace /oper passwords in the start.txt 

(line 36) with your passwords and replace this new start.txt for the one 

sub-folder text and you will have one mean bot 

Ultimate in self defence and protection



I suck when it comes to help files if ya have probs e-mail me
