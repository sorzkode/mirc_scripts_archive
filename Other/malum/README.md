  4.Notes from the creator (PyroMan)





  1. Welcome New Malum users!! MaLum is a All around script with many great

  features including: A portscanner, encoder, e-mail checker!!, server 

  list, /longtext, fserve, /mhelp, and much much more! I recomend you use 

  the /mhelp, it is a great help to new users. When you start MaLum 

  everything should already be loaded in aliases, popups, and remote.  If 

  not go to section #3,Loading Malum. If you need further help you can 

  contact me(KRAkeR) and/or PyroMan in #MaLum on the undernet weekdays from

  3:00pm to around 10:00pm (usually).   





  2. WELCOME BACK previous MaLum users! MaLum 6.0 has many changes and 

  updates. One big change is that MaLum doesn't use .ini's in the aliases, 

  popups, or remote anymore. It is now .mal's. You dont need popups.ini, 

  aliases.ini, aliases2.ini, talkers.ini, remote.ini, raw.ini, ctcps.ini, 

  events.ini, and events2.ini. If you still have thoses in your directory  

  you should delete them. DO NOT delete any other .ini's other than the 

  ones listed above!!! There are a few other new features in MaLum such as 

  /mhelp, cool msg, screwban, more servers to server list, and much much 

  more. For more read versions.txt. If you need further help you can contact 

  me(KRAkeR) and/or PyroMan in #MaLum on the undernet weekdays from 3:00pm 

  to around 10:00pm (usually).

  4. Notes from the creator

	Well a LOT has changed over the past few weeks...

I got in trouble at school and my dad put Win 3.1 on my PC 

because of it. I also got a new and FASTER modem (good thing).

Last but not least I have kicked out kolors and now have my friend

from school KRAkeR taking his place.
