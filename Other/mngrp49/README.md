SECTION 1 - Minimal Features



The Fetch Command



Use Fetch | Script to fetch a script.  You will be given a 

file selection dialog in which you will the mirc.ini of the

script you want to fetch.  Once that is done, =MooDoo= will

fetch the script.



The Seamless Fetch Command



The command Fetch | Seamless Fetch is used to fetch scripts

that are fairly large and want to access files.  When a script

is fetched with regular Fetch and wants to access files, it

will not be able to do so.



Default Script



The default script is a script that you use most often.  You

have quick access to it with F2 or /default once it is set.

Use Settings | Default Script to set the path for the mirc.ini

of your default script.



Logging



The logging feature will log the status bar into status.log.







SECTION 2 - Intermediate Features



Installing Scripts



You can use Install Script | Setup or ZIP to install a script.

The setup option will run the script's setup program.  The ZIP

option will unzip it into a subdirectory and automatically insert

it into the Script Database.



The Path Feature



When you have scripts that specify the wrong paths in their mirc.ini

file, you can easily fix this with INI Files | Insert | Correct Path.

This command will change all the paths to the path of the actual

mirc.ini.  If you turn on INI Files | Auto-Insert | Correct Path,

the path feature will be automatically executed when you fetch a file.



The User Information Feature



If you hate constantly filling out user information, this feature will

help you.  First, set the information in Settings | User Info.  Then

you can use INI Files | Insert | User Info to instantly insert the

info into the selected file.  Also, you can use the Auto-Insert feature

just like in The Path Feature.



The Extras



The extras are there for you to put them to your own use.  Extras | Unzip

will unzip any file to a specified directory, and Run DOS Command will

run a DOS command.







SECTION 3 - Advanced Features



The Script Database 



The script database is used to store script information, and you can

thus easily manage a large number of scripts.  When you create a new

entry using Database | New Entry, pick out the fetching sequence: the

regular or the seamless (see SECTION 1 The Fetch Command and The 

Seamless Fetch Command).  Once this is set, you can fetch the entries

with Fetch | Database Entry.  Erase entries and completely clear the

database with Database | Erase Entry and Clear Database.  You can see

all the entries in your database by using Database | List.  All entries

set for seamless fetch will appear with an (s).  And finally, view 

entry info (ie name, time created, etc.) with Database | Entry Info.



The Custom INIs



When you encounter a script without an mirc.ini, you cannot fetch it,

or do anything else with it from manager for that matter.  You can

create an mirc.ini for it.  First, create a default mirc.ini with

Custom | Generate MIRC.INI.  Then, use Custom | Add, to specify the

necessery files.
