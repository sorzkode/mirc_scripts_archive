-Introduction-



	 O.R. NickServ is a bot for mIRC that permits users to "register" a 

 nickname so that it belongs to the person that registered, and others cannot

 use it.  This also makes it harder for someone to "nick collide" another us-

 er.  This will attract more people to your network and give it a more pro-

 fessional look.  Setup is very easy and you should have no problems with the

 bot at all.  For info on what's new in this version, please see the included

 file 'updates.txt'.



-Setup- 



 Step 1. Open the file "orns152.zip" with WinZip or PKZip and extract it to  

         its own directory (you've probably already done this).



 Step 2. Copy the mIRC executable(mirc32.exe or mirc.exe) to the directory. 



      Note: If you don't have the mIRC executable, you can find download 

            sites at http://www.mirc.co.uk/.



 Step 3. Run the mIRC executable and connect to your server.



 Step 4. Once connected, issue the /oper command so that your bot has IRCop

        status.



-Questions and Comments-



     If you have any problems, questions, or comments, you can get in touch 

 with me in any of the following ways:



  Send email to odinrex@hotmail.com

  Meet me on DALnet (usualy in #Hawkee.com)

  Send me a memo on DALnet (/msg MemoServ send OdinRex <message>)







---



     One last thing, many people have asked me if I could write a ChanServ 

bot for mIRC.  The answer is no.  It would be impossible.  In order to have

a working ChanServ bot, you would need to have a network with a modified 

version of IRCd.  So please, no emails/memos asking for a ChanServ.
