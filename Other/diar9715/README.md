First, verify that you got ALL these 15 files:



   install.bat

   1024.dia

   800.dia

   about.dia

   aliases.dia

   call.dia

   finger.dia

   help.dia

   intro.dia

   log.dia

   popups.dia

   remote.dia

   status.dia

   diar.gif

   install.txt



You need at least mIRC 4.72 in order to make this script

works properly. So, why not download the latest version

of mIRC from http:\www.mirc.co.uk ?

It also works with both the 16 and 32-bit versions.



Installation is easy:



1. Install an another copy of mIRC into your harddrive

   to run this script on. You may install it in ANY

   directory you want. Do NOT let the installation

   program Add Icons to Programs Manager. You have to do

   it by yourself afterwards.



2. Move all files, as mentioned above, into that directory.



3. Run install.bat from that directory.



4. Finally, run mIRC and finish your settings.



5. If you want, you can create a shortcut/icon to the script.
