[01:11] <q4> TopicsAddon version 1.o, nov 9.

[01:11] <q4> by q

[01:11] <Suss> I need some help!

[01:11] <q4> Help? with what?

[01:12] <q4> well...here is some info anyway...

 





This simple little addon remembers old topics in all channels on all nets.





MiniHelp!                 - This helpful thingy.

-

Flush old topics on start - Removes old topics when you start mirc.

Get topic on join         - Grab current topic when you join a channel

Net-sensitive             - Different topics/channels for different IRC-nets

-

Show startup message      - Enable/disable the startup message... so if you

                            don't find it as beautiful as me, turn it off.





To use it, simply rightclick in any channel and choose TopicsAddon.







[01:11] <q4> Nice to know;





It saves all topicinfo in a file called topics.ini and it is placed in your

addon directory.



btw, I got the idea for this addon from the irc-client xircon. (www.xircon.com)





.thanks
```
