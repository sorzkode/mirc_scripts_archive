       P&P compatibility, documentation, mIRC 5.5 bug fixes by Kiwi_



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this script a while ago and have been using it for a few months now and it is a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, when mIRC 5.5 came along I found it didn't work properly anymore, so I had to fix several things and decided to revise the menu slightly too, to make it a little easier to use.



Because I enjoy using it so much, I thought it would be kinda cool to have it as a P&P addon so that other people can enjoy it too!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



                              INSTRUCTIONS



Firstly, use the /addon command to install the script - there is only one file called TRANSLATE.MRC and this text file.  To use the script, simply right click in a channel and choose 'Translation' from the menu



-----------------------------------------------------------------------



                              OPTIONS MENU



* Translate Incoming Text: Translates all text spoken to you in the channel - anything you type is not affected.



* Translate Outgoing Text: Translates all text you speak in the channel - anything other channel members type is not affected.



	By keeping both of the above boxes checked, you have full I/O 	translated, which is best.  I keep them both on all the time.



* Replace true text with translation: This option removes the 'normal text' and replaces it with the language you have selected.  If you have this option unchecked, you will see the original text also, which makes for quite a confusing screen.



* Prefix Messages with Language Info - puts a [en_fr] or [en_it] etc in front of every sentence in the channel.  It doesn't do anything else, so its kind of unnecessary, which means I always leave it off.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                           SELECTING A LANGUAGE



On the translator menu, it will say under the options 'Select #channel Language'.  This means that no language is currently set for this channel.



To select a language you have a choice of 2 options:



1 - Translate into English, which allows you to change YOUR english into another language, and the other language spoken in the channel into english so you can read it.  This is the one you want usually.



2 - Translate all English text into a different language. This option is useful if your queries do not come up as windows, or if you just want to translate something quickly, because then you can paste what you want into the edit box in an empty channel and see what they said.  Also useful if you want to learn how to speak another language, rather than just using the translator.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                           SOME IMPORTANT POINTS



1 - After you have selected a language for the channel, a file called TRANSL.TXT will be created in your addons directory.  It contains information about which languages should be applied to which channel, so you have to remember to turn the translation off for that channel sometimes.  When a language is selected the 'Select #channel Language' on the menu will be replaced with 'Stop Translating #channel' - just click on it to stop the translation for that channel.



2 - Be VERY careful of spelling mistakes, because they will NOT be translated and then you will feel silly.  The same goes with speakers of other languages - if they make spelling mistakes too, the translator will not understand what the word is and will not be able to translate it.



3 - Be aware that the translator is not 100% perfect and occasionally words will be translated out of context. Try to keep your conversation in reasonably simple words, and avoid slang where possible.



4 - If you intend using the script together with a friend, you will have a lot of laughs and fun, but not terribly much conversation.  What happens is that the script will translate your friends bad french into even worse french and then send it back to you...hehehe...you have to see it to believe it, its hilarious :)  However, I have been in #French and been able to carry on reasonable conversations with people, although it will get fairly obvious that
