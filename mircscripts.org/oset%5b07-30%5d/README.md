-----[ Description ]--------------------------------------------



Enhanced Text v1.20 is an acronym addon with some extra goodies.  It turn the usuall "lol" to "Laughing Out Loud" etc., but with the option of choosing the style and colour.  Some acronyms can be turned on while others are off (all on by default).  Also has a feature which automatically changes any input text to the specified colour.  Simple Auto Welcome and Hurry Back feature is included. This addon has more words than any other acronym system that I have come across. eNjOy
