________________________________________________________________



Because I liked the Mp3 System that I put together in my script,

I thought I would make it into an addon for other people to use.

So here it is...

________________________________________________________________



Works on mIRC v5.91 - Haven't tried it on others!

Extract the mp3system.mrc into your mirc directory and simply 

type;



//load -rs mp3system.mrc



And voila!
