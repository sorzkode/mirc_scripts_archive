   mIRC, this Addon uses "LightStrike Swamp v1.0 DLL"



4. How to install



   Unzip the zipfile to your mIRC dir, a subfolder called "ampstatus" should be automatically

   created within your mIRC dir while unzipping.

   After the file has been unzipped fire up mIRC and type: "/load -rs ampstatus\ampstatus.mrc"



5. How to show my stuff ?



   After the script has been loaded, a "winamp" option is added to all popup menu's, from

   there you can use this Addon.

   You can also type "/sayamp" to use it.
