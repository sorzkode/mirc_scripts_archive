About=iShare was first made for sharing my scriptfiles/dll files with my friends $+  $chr(44) but then I started thinking about making a complete filehsharing script for the mIRC client. The result is what you are using now! $crlf $crlf $crlf Note that this is version $-(sys,vr2) and is far from perfect. Ive tried to make this script as "idiot" proof as I could but its still not as good as I should wish.. $crlf $crlf I have no idea of how long time Ive used on making this script because Ive had brakes and so on. But Ive taken my time to get the best possible result. $str($crlf,2)  My scripting/coding is far from perfect. Some of my scripting methods is hard and unnecessary but this is how I script. I wanted to make something new and something that was just made by me. Too many scripts/addons out there look just like one another and that wasnt what I wanted to make. 
about2= $str($crlf,2) I hope my script is innovative  and creative and I hope you like it.  $str($crlf,2)  Any bugs/errors or suggestions mail me at: baresteffen@gmail.com - superhelten 2005  $str($crlf,2)  $+($chr(40),And please excuse my bad english,$chr(41))
Configuration= Setting up iShare is easy. $str($crlf,2) Just type /iShare or select "iShare" from your menus. Then Select the "Options" tab in the iShare dialog. In this tab you can change almost every setting in the script. $str($crlf,2) Some of the things you can change is: $str($crlf,3) • Download folder $str($crlf,2) • Shared folder $str($crlf,2) • Max out speed $str($crlf,2) • Max downloads/uploads $str($crlf,2) • Sound on filecompletion/file fail and so on $str($crlf,2) • iShare channel (click on Channel in the list to the left to see more information about this) $str($crlf,2) • You can specify wich EFNet server you would like to connect to. You can read more about why you cannot change network in "Servers" on the left side of this dialog! $str($crlf,2) • You can even click all the (!) buttons behind every option to get more information!
Sharing=iShare was made for sharing files over IRC. Therefore it is important that those who can share/send files do so. If no-one shares, there will be no point in using iShare! $str($crlf,2) Note: If you are behind a router/firewall its not sure that you can send files through iShare! Please check this before you enable sharing. If a user has enabled sharing and is unable to send files he will cause a "File sending failed" error with those who are downloading from him. $str($crlf,2) To enable sharing: Open iShare -> Click on the "Options" tab. Select the "On" in "Enable sharing" and set you shared folder! $crlf Remember: If you select a folder with many files to share iShare can "stop" for some time. Please wait untill it is finished calculating the folder size before you do anything! $str($crlf,2) Your current share status is: $-(config,share!) $iif($-(config,share!) == on,$crlf $crlf Sharing: $-(sys,sharedfiles) file(s),)
Connecting=In order to $_logo to work you need to be connected to a EFNet server. You can select what EFNet server that suits you best in the "Options" tab. $str($crlf,2) You can also select "Auto connect on start" from the menu on top of the iShare dialog $+ $chr(39) then $_logo will automatically connect to a EFNet server the next time you start the script! $str($crlf,2) If you are having problems with connecting to a EFNet server for some reason please read the mIRC.hlp (help file) or visit a #Help channel on another server. $str($crlf,2) See more information about why iShare only works on EFNet in "Servers"
Channel=iShare needs a channel for its users to share files in. The channel is used for sending and receiving search words. When you search for something in iShare you actually send a "@find <encoded searchword>" to the channel.  $str($crlf,2) If you change the standard iShare channel you wont receive any search results from the standard iShare channel. If you have changed channel and want to change it back but cant remember the channel just press "Default" in the iShare options tab. Read more about this in "Resetting" on the left list.  $str($crlf,2) Standard channel from your config.ini file: $-(sys,ochn) $str($crlf,2) Channel you are using now: $-(sys,chn) $str($crlf,2)  If the standard iShare channel should for some strange reason be closed or anything please see the iShare web page for information.
Channel2=$str($crlf,2) If you have selected to "Hide search channel" from the menu in the iShare dialog then you will not see the share channel in the mIRC status bar. You can still see it if you choose from mIRCs statusbar "Window -> #iShare search channel". $str($crlf,2) The "Hide search channel" option is there because there is really no need to see the actual search channel. But if you feel like it just set "Hide search channel" to "No" from the top menu in the iShare dialog! $str($crlf,2) Current status: $str($crlf,1) Hide search channel: $replace($-(config,hide),1,Yes,0,No))
Searching=In order for you to be able to search with $_logo you have to be connected to a EFNet server and you have to be in the channel specified in "Options" tab. $str($crlf,2) If you are connected and in a iShare channel you can search for what you want. $str($crlf,2) Just enter your search word(s) in the search box and click "Search". Note that if you search for different things quickly after one another the results from the first search can appear in the second search results. This is because when you search for something and a user has that file he sends you a msg with the file details. Some users may have some lag and therefor results may come a little bit slow sometimes. $str($crlf,2) You can only send one search word every 5 seconds to the standard iShare channel. Please do not override this system or it will result in a kick/ban! $str($crlf,2) 
Searching2=Note that search words are encoded when you send them to the iShare channel but an average mIRC user can without problems decode your searchword so keep in mind that what you search for can be seen by others! $str($crlf,2) In the searchbox you can see the file name $+ $chr(44) size $+ $chr(44) nick of the person sharing the file $+ $chr(44) que and speed!  $str($crlf,2)  Note that the speed isn`t necessarily the correct speed you are going to get when downloading. Each user can set their own upload speed and therefore you cant rely on that the speed you are seeing on a user is the correct one!
Downloading=To download a file just dobbelclick a file in the search results box or select the file in the list then click "Download" at the bottom of the iShare dialog! $str($crlf,2) Please be careful with what you download. People may share files containg virus/spyware etc. $str($crlf,2) If you click on a file to download it but nothing happends then look in the bottom of the iShare dialog on the "messagebar". It should appear some sort of error message. If you are unable to download a file from a user then it may be that the que is full with that user or that is a erroneous filename. See "Messagebar" in the left list for more info about messagebar messages!
Transfers=In the transfer tab you can monitor your downloads and uploads. Downloads and uploads are shown with filename $+ $chr(44) size $+ $chr(44) sent/received $+ $chr(44) progress in %  $+ $chr(44) status and nickname. $str($crlf,2) You can also dobbelclick a transfer to get extended information about that transfer.  $str($crlf,2) If you want to clear your transfers list just select which files to be cleared from the dropdown box beneath the transfer windows! $str($crlf,2) You also have the option to cancel a transfer and whois the user you are downloading/uploading from/to.

Servers=In $_logo(v) it is only possible to use iShare on EFNet servers. This is because I want to gather as many iShare users as possible on one server and one channel. The more users using the standard server and channel $+ $chr(44) the bigger the chance of finding what you are looking for. $str($crlf,2) The reason I have choosen EFNet to be the iShare server is because its a reliabale network at the same time as they do not condemn filesharing! $str($crlf,2) If for some reason iShare should not be allowed to continue on EFNet please see the iShare web page for information! The official servernetwork is EFNet and the official ishare search channel is #iShare!Search 
#iShare=#iShare on EFNet is the official iShare help/chat channel. If you have questions or problems please join #iShare on EFNet to get assistance. $str($crlf,2)  #iShare is ONLY a help/chat channel $+ $chr(44) NOT a search channel. Do NOT set your iShare script to use #iShare as search channel. The use of @find/search in #iShare can/will get you kicked or banned.
Nickname=Usually when you use mIRC you get a nickname that you like. When using iShare there is no need to get a fancy nickname since iShare isn`t meant to be used for chatting. Select "Nickname options" from "Miscellaneous" in the top menu in the iShare dialog. $str($crlf,2) In "nickname options" you can select whether to use your own nick or let iShare create a random nick for you every time you connect.
Filetypes=Select Filetypes under "Miscellaneous" in the top menu in the iShare dialog to set wich filetypes iShare should automatically ignore. $str($crlf,2) Standard filetypes to ignore is: $crlf  • .exe $crlf • .pif $crlf •. vbs $str($crlf,2) Please ignore fileextensions that you may think can contain virus/spyware and so on.. $str($crlf,2) When you have added a fileextension that should be ignored iShare will not show results containing this filetype as file extension. 
Messagebar=The messagebar is the text field at the bottom of the iShare dialog. The messagebar is there to show you messages and notices of importance. $str($crlf,2) All error messages from other users will be shown in the messagebar and most of the scripts error messages will be shown there..  $str($crlf,2)  Some of the messages that will be shown in the messagebar: $str($crlf,2)  • "Error: Que is full! Please try later or another file." $crlf This error appears when you try to download a file from a user that has a full que. It may show as he has several free spaces for you to download but other users can download from the same person as you at almost the same time and therefore the que will not be updated until next search. 
messagebar2=$crlf $crlf • "Error: File does not seem to exist! Please try another user/file." $crlf This error occurs when a user is sending back results with a file that does not exist in his shared folder. The only time this can happen is if the user is deleting/moving the file after you have searched for it! $str($crlf,2) • "You are already downloading that file!" $crlf This error means that you are trying to download two similar files. $str($crlf,2) • "Search result from <user> rejected - Filetype ignored!" $crlf This error means that a user sent you a search result containing a ignored file extension wich you set in the "Filtypes" dialog.  $str($crlf,2) This is not all the error messages/info messages you will see in the messagebar but you get an idea of why the messagebar is there. When messagebar is not in use it will only show  $_logo(v) :: Ready
Default=If you want to set your iShare back to default click "Default" in the "Options" tab. This will reset the complete script and all stats $+ $chr(44) configuration and logs. Shared folder and download folder will be set to: $crlf $crlf  $mircdirdownload
Logs=Current log status: $str($crlf,2) Log downloads: $replace($-(logs,gets),1,On,0,Off) $str($crlf,1) Log uploads: $replace($-(logs,sends),1,On,0,Off) $str($crlf,1) Log download fails: $replace($-(logs,getfail),1,On,0,Off)  $str($crlf,1)  Log upload fails: $replace($-(logs,sendfail),1,On,0,Off) $crlf $crlf Select from the top menu in the iShare dialog "Miscellaneous" -> "Logs" to open the log central. In the log central you can select wich logs that should be activated. $str($crlf,2) You can select to enable 4 different logs: $str($crlf,2)  • Gets - Logs what $+ $chr(44) when and who you downloaded something from (Gets.txt). $str($crlf,2) •  - Logs what  $+ $chr(44) when and who you uploaded something to(Sends.txt). $str($crlf,2) • Getfail - Logs all files that were not downloaded properly or that you got a error on when downloading. $str($crlf,2) • Sendfail - Logs all files that were unsuccessfully sent by you (sendfail.txt) 
Logs2=$str($crlf,2) In log central you can also view and delete logs
Updates=Select "Check for updates" from top menu in the iShare dialog under "Miscellaneous. Click "Check for updates now" to see if there has been any updates to iShare. $crlf $crlf When a updatecheck is complete you can see in the update dialog all details about the update. Everything from where the file can be downloaded to size  and author will appear in the update dialog if a update is ready. Click 'Download' in the Update Central when ready to get the latest version of iShare. $str($crlf,2) All iShare updates will come in .zip file format. This is because then you can update your script with many files at the time without having to download one file at the time. $str($crlf,2) To install a file when iShare has completed the download simply click the button 'Open file' and the zip file will be opened with your standard Unzipping program. $str($crlf,2) If you do not have a zip program at your computer please see www.winzip.com
updates2=$str($crlf,2) To see early screenshots of the next version of iShare please check out the iShare webpage under Screenshots.
Shortcuts=Ive added some shortcuts for you to use so it will be easyier to use iShare. $str($crlf,2) • /iShare  - Opens the iShare main dialog $str($crlf,2) • /iShare logs - Opens the iShare logs dialog. $str($crlf,2) • /iShare files - Opens the filetypes manager $str($crlf,2) • /iShare nick - Opens the iShare nick options dialog $str($crlf,2) • /iShare Connection - Opens the connection status dialog $str($crlf,2) •/iShare update - Opens the update manager $str($crlf,2) • /iShare Connect - If you are not connected to a server this alias connects you to the server specified in the config. $str($crlf,2) • /iShare Help - Opens this dialog $str($crlf,2) • /iShare check - This is the most useful one.. It checks to see if your configuration is working. iShare does this automatically but if something fails like a timer or something this is good to have.. $crlf This check also repairs missing/invalid configuration.

1=In this mIRC client you now are using some options has been changed..
2=$str($crlf,2) In order to iShare to work properly DCC-GET has to be on "auto-resume if exists". This is because of problems with transfers and so on.
3=$str($crlf,2) This mIRC client is automatically  set to auto receive incoming files (DCC gets). Still iShare does not accept any files sent to you if they are not choosen by you from the iShare search box!
4=$str($crlf,2) That means that you can not use iShare to receive normal DCC gets. When you are about to download something iShare gives the person you download from a 20 seconds delay to send you the file or else the file
5= $crlf will be ignored
6=$crlf $crlf Everything in iShare that has to do with sending/receiving files has been meant to be as secure as possible. The only risk is that people sharing virus and spyware. So please be careful with what you download  and check the "Filetypes" options in iShare to see what file types you want to ignore! $crlf For more help regarding any of this see /ishare help
7= $str($crlf,2) Thats it. To connect to a server and start downloading open iShare (/iShare) and click "Connect" from the top menu! $str($crlf,2) If you are having problems downloading/sending files with iShare please see our guide at $-(config,url) on how to enable sending/downloading through routers or firewalls! $str($crlf,2) superhelten - 2005
