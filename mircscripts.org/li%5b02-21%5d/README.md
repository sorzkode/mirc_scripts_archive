Hi, that's my second DLL for mIRc.

It's Possible to set the Background to transparent now.

It's also possible to set the Transparent value to a different one.



usage:



/dll li.dll TitleSet Your mIRC Title 



That will change the mIRC Title -> But you should not even use it if its forbidden

in your country to change the mIRC to your thing.



/dll li.dll trans transvalue



transvalue can be 0-200. A good value is 0/100/200, but just check it out.

It will make the mIRC Transparent.



Thats the first dll of me, more features will be included soon.



#li @ de.quakenet.org 



-> Searching for good C/C++ coders. If you're qualified, contact me.
