## 📋 Text Content (from readthis.txt)

Jeepster's IRC Numeric Reference

Release 3.0a 



Install Notes:

The release consists of:

1. numeric.hlp

2. numeric.cnt

3. INETWH32.dll

4. readthis.txt



All files should be placed in the same directory.  The INETWH32.dll

simply allows the web links to function from the help.  



If you get an error with the web links portion of the help, you may

need setbrowse.exe, which was originally provided with the release

2 of the numerics, but I had so few requests for it, I've decided to

drop it.  It is available from my website:
