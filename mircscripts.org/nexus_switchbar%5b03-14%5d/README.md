[ Credits ]

The colors for these icons were taken from Liam's High Colour mIRC Icon pack, and are most appreciateivly used with his permission. Liam is fully aware that I have released this icon pack on mircscripts.org, and has consented to this in an email I sent to him two days ago as of this writing. His original icons can also be found on mircscripts.org, if you want them. All icons created in ArtIcons Pro 3.25.
