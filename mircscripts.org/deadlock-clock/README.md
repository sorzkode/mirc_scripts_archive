-+ Features Explanation:



  Alarm:

  If you have something to do, and can't be late, relax and have fun at

mirc. What you have to do, is set the DigitalClock Alarm to warn you

the time of your job/lunch/and etc.

  To configure the alarm, open the DigitalClock, and click in Alarm. In

the dialog, the check has 3 statements. The first, is the unmarked box,

and it means that the Alarm is OFF. The second, is the marked box, and

it means that the Alarm is ON. The third and last, is the indefined

box, and means that the Alarm is ON, and if you close the DigitalClock,

the alarm *DOESN'T* work.

  Now you set the hours and minutes like: 20 and 30 .. the alarm will

warn you at 20hr and 30min. After warn, the DigitalClock turn the alarm

OFF and unset the time.



  Color Setup:

  You can change the color of the numbers in the DigitalClock. You can

set 4(four) diferent colors(green, red, blue and white). The green is

the default color.

  To change, open the DigitalClock and click LAYOUT. In the dialog, you

click and the color you think is good, and then, click OK.



  Size Setup:

  The DigitalClock changes the size too. You can choice 2 sizes. The

size of the DigitalClock window DON'T change, just the numbers.

-+ Author Notes:



 First, I'm sorry because I don't speak English very well, and you can

find a lot of grammar errors and mistakes. Anyway.. I'd like to thank

to HeHe`, he said something like: " It's nice.. don't stop it. ". So,

I didn't stop.

 One of the addon's tester ask me: Can I use that in my script? And I

answer: Yes, but remember, I made it, give to me some credits.. :)

 If you have any problems with the DigitalClock, send me an email(the

address is on top of this file).

 Well.. I think that's all folks.
