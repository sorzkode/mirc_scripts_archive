 1. About:



  Well... i guess everybody knows what a seen system is. For those who don't know 

  what a seen system is i'll explain it. =)

  Basically a seen system stores the last user action.

  e.g: 

  Nickname has left from #mIRC -> the seen system will save the last "Nickname" action

  witch was parting from #mIRC channel.



  Nickname quits IRC (leaving) -> here the last action was quitting IRC stating: "leaving"



  So, when you type "!seen nickname" (note: !seen is the default trigger) you'll get

  something like this:



  "last seen was parting from #mIRC at 21:56 (08/04/2001)" (e.g.)



  Well... i guess you understand what this script do, if you don't sorry... it was a good

  attempt! =)





 2. How to install



  It's (very) easy =) just extract all the files contained in the .zip file to mIRC

  directory.

  Now execute your mIRC executable and type:



  /load -rs seen.mrc



  Click "yes" when a "mIRC Script Warning" show up!

  (don't panic... it's just a "should i run the initialization commands?")



  Well... look to the status window all you see what you need to do. (/seen to setup)





 3. Setup dialog



  This dialog can be accessed by typing: /seen



  Options:



  * use seen system - activate/deactivate the script



  * on startup clear seen list - if you turn this option on everytime you run mIRC seen

  list will be deleted.

         ____________

  * use |____________| as seen trigger - default trigger is !seen ... feel free to 

  change it!



  * respond only in these channels - only specified channels will have the seen system

  running...



  * ignore all these channels - all the specified channels will be ignored.





 4. Search dialog



  This dialog can be access by typing: /search



  In this dialog you can search for the information of a user.

  2 parameters are needed to perform the search:



  * Nickname



  and



  * on channels



  if you don't specify any of these parameters you'll get fatal errors!





 5. Troubleshooting



  Well... i didn't find any bugs... if you find one mail me! 



  I test this script with mIRC 5.82, 5.9 and 5.91 32bits... soooooo i recommend you

  to use this script with this version.



  If you have any problems while using this script check if you're using mIRC 5.82,

  5.9 or 5.91, check also if your mIRC path does not contain spaces they are *not* 

  supported by mIRC!
