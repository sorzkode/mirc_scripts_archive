Unzip all the files in the zip file to your mIRC directory.  Open mIRC and type:



/load -rs dmp3/dmp3.mrc

or...type

//load -rs $shortfn($findfile(C:\,dmp3.mrc,1)) 



After Loading the helpfile will open to explain how to use the addon.

Openning the mp3 player itself, go to your menu bar at the top of mIRC

and there you will see an entry for D-mp3 Player

Note - this addon plays mp3's only.



Hopefully everything else on using the addon is contained in the helpfile.
