; *** Why make an addon based on systray.dll?

; Systray.dll should be a must in every script, its a nice and simple way to show anykind of informations

; and lots of people don't know how to work with systray.dll, so I decided to make an addon with the purpose

; of introducing systray.dll in personal more scripts.

: ***



; *** How can I use it?

; This addon isn't very hard to use, you just need to open the main configuration dialog, you can access it

; on the menubar popup, or doing /systray.

; When you open the dialog you have a checkbox list with several mIRC events, to edit each one of those 

; events you just need to double click on the selected event that you want to edit. 

; To activate or desactivate a popup message, you just need to check or uncheck the checkbox of the event that

; you don't want to view. You can edit almost every mIRC events.

; You can edit the title that appears on the system tray, the double click, and the right click.

; ***



; *** Commands?

; /syslog - opens systray messages log history

; /sysabout - opens systray about dialog

; /systray - opens systray configuration dialog

; ***



; *** Next version? Updates?

; This was just a remake of the old systray addon that I have..

; In the next version I want to add a popup editor, to perfom the right click event

; and I want to add more events.

; Don't know when im going to do a next update, I will not say dates.
