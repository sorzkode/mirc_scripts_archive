Next v1.00  







###--------------------------- Information -------------------------------------------###





Next is an all around mIRC script which was created by YA-HA (formaly known as Miranda).

The main theme behind creating Next was to create an all around functionality script

for my liking, for the ego, for the fun, and mostly for the challange.



Next can be used both by experts and newbies to the IRC.

The script is easy to use and comes with highly customizeable abilities.







###--------------------------- Installation ------------------------------------------###





After you downloaded the zipped archive file, you have to 

extract the zip file first. to do so you need

any compression handeling application such as Winzip(www.winzip.com), 

WinRAR (www.rarsoft.com), WinACE (www.winace.com) or any other compression program that 

supports the zip extension (windows XP supports this without any program, 

just open the file and it'll open it in a file browser).



Second, you should download the last version of mIRC which 

available at www.mirc.com and copy "mIRC.exe" to the 

extracted script directory. 



Now, all you have to do is to double click on "mIRC.exe" and enjoy yourself.  

 



###--------------------------- Known Issues ------------------------------------------###

 



 1) Rightclick Beeping - Merely mIRC bug rather than

                         being actually *Next* bug.



    To stop this funky sound you may do the following:

    

    * Open the "sounds" under control panel       

    * drop down to Deafult sound which is under

      "Windows" Application icon in the Events list

    * Select "(None)" from the combo box

    * Click OK and you are all set!
