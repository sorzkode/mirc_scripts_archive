========================



Nice and sleek picture window popups for your pleasure. Don't think of these as

"popups" in terms of right-click menus, these popups are more like the "balloon

tips" you see in various Windows applications.



To use it, just load the script with "/load -rs ppop.mrc".

After that, you can configure it by typing "/ppop.setup".



A few tricks you should keep in mind while using this add-on:

- If there are some popups in the queue and you want to get rid of all of them,

  shift+click on it to make it delete the queue.

- If you right-click a popup, mIRC becomes active.



You can also use this command in your own scripts. The usage is as follows:

//ppop <header text> $chr(1) <message>



If  you distribute this addon or parts of it in your own script, please give me

credit.





That's all, have fun.
