[-- Icon Description: --]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Jaffa is a complete system replacement set, designed to change the look of all

the icons on your system; Your desktop, start menu, folders, drives, files etc...



The style is a bright tasty orange and grey, mixed with a healthy splash of colour

here and there... and has an almost toy like quality to it, whilst still keeping a

professional clean look.



Originally codenamed 'Solero', the final name of the set was changed to 'Jaffa'

after the orange-centred Jaffa cake biscuits. :)
