| 1. Informations  \

|___________________\



Alse is a script for mIRC. It is all developped in Picture Window. That means his interface is entirely 

unique and there are many themes to change the appearance of the script. To make it work, download mIRC 

(http://www.mirc.com), the most popular IRC client.



This script was made thinking in the way to make it easy to use. So it should meet all your needs

on IRC. If you encounter any problems during using the script, you could send me an e-mail at: 

DixrouE@hotmail.com or on MSN with the same e-mail.



|\

| 2. Installation  \

|___________________\



To install the script, you have to extract the ZIP file (with WinZIP, WinRAR, etc). After, 

copy a "mIRC.exe" (last version) in this directory. The two reasons mIRC is not included in the 

script are: 



1- Khaled Mardam-Bey wrote on his website that mIRC should'nt be included in scripts. 

2- To save space and bandwidth (for you and for our host).

| 3. Story         \

|___________________\



Alse began in 2004 when Alon3 said to DixrouE that a 100% picwin script could be very interesting. Then, 

the work began a couple of days after. Alon3 began to draw the "Alse design". He did it drawing all windows 

controls one by one in MS-Paint like pixel art works and I coded it after... The GUI engine was developped 

slowly but became what it is today. Many ideas which had been envisaged at the beginning were abandoned for 

their complexity and what they brought for us.



My principal motivation for this script especially was the originality. Scripts entirely in Picture Window 

are not very abundant. I like unique things. So, I decided to go through this adventure!

Alon3 is a secondary student who is passionate by design. He does a great job in his domain and he did a 

splendid work with "Alse".



I'm a student at Cgep Andr-Laurendeau in computers sciences. I am passionate by all which touches 

programming.
