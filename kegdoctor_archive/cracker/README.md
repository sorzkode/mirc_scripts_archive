ok so many ppl have asked my about this i guess i have to write a help file.



Well i guess first thing is installing it. Many ppl r haveing problems with

the /load command. So to make it more simpler just move the other file called

crack.mrc into your mirc directory. The mirc directory is the directory 

were all your mirc is run out of. This is probably c:\mirc\  unless you are 

running another script like 7th sphere then it will be c:\sphere\ I hope u 

can find it. Now that u have crack.mrc moved into your mirc directory open 

mirc. Then type this in  /load -rs crack.mrc  and it should load in just 

fine.



Next is the word list part, if u know nufin about hacking then this is new

to u. If u r a hacker/cracker this will just use a word list/dictionary file

that u specify. Now for the rest of us, a word list/dictionary file is a file

that contains a list of common passwords. This script selects one password

at a time and sees if nick/chanserv accepts it as a password for the nick/chan

that u r cracking. I have included a small word list with this. U should move

that to the mirc directory too i guess just so it is simpler for u. If you

would like a more advanced word list goto 

http://www.antionline.com/archives/wordlists/

they have a couple u can download there.



Now to start it first right click on the status window(the window u c

PING? PONG! in all the time) then there is a menu structure like this



stuff from ur old script up here

--------------------------------

Password Cracker >



then when u go over Password Cracker > u get



stuff from ur old script up here

--------------------------------

Password Cracker > Nick Cracker >

		   Chan Cracker >



now when u go over Nick Cracker > u get



stuff from ur old script up here

--------------------------------

Password Cracker > Nick Cracker > Setup >

		   Chan Cracker > Start

				  Stop



Now when u go over Setup > u get



stuff from ur old script up here

--------------------------------

Password Cracker > Nick Cracker > Setup > Set Nick

		   Chan Cracker > Start   Set Dic

				  Stop    Set Line



Now before u start it u have to set each one of those.



Nick == the nick of the person u r trying to crack

Dic  == the word list/dictionary file

Line == the line of the word list to start on (usually 1)



I hope this helps with the menu a little and the channel menu is the exact

same way. 1 last thing before u start a crack i would leave all the rooms

your in so that it dosne't slow u down.
