## 📋 Text Content (from README_IMPORTANT.txt)

# kanov14: instructions - read carefully

# kano.net for more info...



1  The ZIP file should be unzipped to your XIRCON directory. It installs itself

   into its own directory.

2  RUN (double-click) the .REG file in your xircon\kano directory. It makes

   life that much easier. You must CLOSE XIRCON before running this.

3  FON files in the xircon\kano\fonts directory should be moved into

   c:\windows\fonts.

4  You have to LOAD a COLOR INI from the XIRCON PREFERENCES menu, COLORS tab.

   See the folder 'xircon\kano\Color Schemes' for more options.

5  Use a FONT in the ZIP -- gte437.fon or ibmpc. Do NOT use something

   idiotic like Times or Arial or Fixedsys or Courier.

6  Type /theme to load a theme. It will auto-load from then on until you decide

   to use another one.

7  To load an addon (*.ka) stick it in your_xirc_dir\addons (type /reload to

   activate it.)

8  Use /help! I spent a lot of time on it! Make me happy! Try /help aliases

   and /help <alias name> for specific help. If you plan on using kanotcl

   then please look through help to get the most out of the script.

   The script does a hell of a lot. It's just not all obvious.

9  As a reward for reading the readme... To stop autojoining #kano type

   /ajoin.

10 There are MORE ADDONS in 'xircon\kano\MORE ADDONS.' these do things like

   bot control and er, other stuff.

11 Get the latest betas, addons, and other cool stuff by typing /kfile.
