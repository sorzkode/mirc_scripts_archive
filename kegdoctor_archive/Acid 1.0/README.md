Welcome To Acid Version 1.0

------------------------------------



This script has taken me almost a year to make, I don't

appreciate rippers or people who like to borrow parts

of my scripts, therefore if I ever hear, see, or catch

you ripping any part of my script I will personelly

rip your head off.



Now I've got that out of my system I will tell you

about the good parts of Acid 1.0.



Acid 1.0 contains many useful features which you can

see in 'Help', but in this script

i have also included a bot. Yes, I did make the bot

for my previous script 'BLiZzArD Script GoLD'

thats why its called 'BLiZzArD BoT', but it is also

used in this script too, like I meen why rename it?

when i made it for 'BLiZzArD GoLD'.



In the script there is also Dialogs, some of you script

users may not know what a 'Dialog' is, so I'll tell

you.

A Dialog is a line of coding that creats a box, much like

when a program pops up, from this box i have enabled you 

to be able to configure the script, open/close utils,

etc. Press F2 to see the main control centre in the

script.



The script also contains an MP3 Player which can play your

MP3's , the MP3 Player has a 'FileShare' if turned 'ON' 

every time you play an MP3 it will enable other people on

your server to 'Download' that current MP3. 

(eg. !tekaz KoRn - Got The Life.mp3)

If something like that is typed your DCC will automatically

send that MP3 to the user.



Thats all that cleaned up so now I will tell you some infomation

about my other scripts & my site.



I have already made 3 other scripts, which are:

** Blizzard Frosty 1.0 - My first script.. it sucks.

** Blizzard 2.2 - What my first script should have been.

** Blizzard Gold 3.1 - Fantastic all round script, very neat

and tidy.



My website is www.geocities.com/nick_x86 at my site you can download

some of my scripts and find out more about my scripts also.

At my site you can download a 'War Addon' which contains

a number of nukers & protection programs all in dialog

it's a must have if your into the netwar bullshit. You can

get the NB-IRC-MP3 addon for mIRC 5.61 at my site also.
