  Introduction:									     

  											     

  RuLeRs Script 3.0 is a advanced script but its allso verry usefull for newbies. fx.	     

  becouse of the F-Key system that allows you to easy Op/Deop/Kick/Ban users and if you     

  use the X/W popups then you will have no problems in coltroling you own channel...	     

  											     

  This script an undernet script. That doesn't mean you can't use it for chat-servers as    

  Dalnet and EFnet... But if you are a Undernet users this script is allmost as good as     

  it gets... ;O)									     

 											     

  If you have any questions about the script or good idears for new features then just      

  gohead and send us an email on RuLeRs@nr-djurs.net. You can allso find us on irc	     

  (undernet), look for users width the following nicks... m|E|g|A or Niffer try channels    

  as: #partyline, #dkservice, #access4all or #vcd.dk				             

 											     

  If you regonize anything in this script its becouse its based on on MEGA-Script 2.0 	     

  (mIRC 5.5) but in this script there isn't half as manny bugs...			     

  I hope u like hvis script couse i have used alot of time makeing it.                      

  If u like the script visit RuLeRs Homepage for updates                                    

 											     

  System Requestments:									     

 											     

  IRC Script doesn't normaly need any wild system requestments, so if you just have an      

  internet connection and you'll about to begin chatting! But the script looks best in	     

  a resolution of 1024*768 or higher. The script is made for mIRC for Win95/98/NT but 	     

  if you have windows 3.11 just go to web site named Http://www.mirc.com and download 	     

  the newest win3.11 version of mIRC.exe. I can't ensure that the script will work 	     

  optimal in windows 3.11 couse it isn't tested in so old a windows version ;O)
