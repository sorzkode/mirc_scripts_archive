 mIRC v5.61 introduction, Khaled Mardam-Bey, 23/09/99



 Welcome to mIRC, an Internet Relay Chat Client.



 mIRC attempts to provide a user-friendly interface for use with

 the Internet Relay Chat network. The IRC network is a virtual

 meeting place where people from all over the world can meet and

 talk.



 To IRC all you need to do is Connect to a server, Join a channel,

 and Chat!



 mIRC will guide you through these initial stages and hopefully

 you'll be chatting in no time. If you get stuck or want to find

 out more about a certain feature, just click on a Help button

 in a window or browse the Help file and you should find lots of

 hints to help you out.



 As you become more experienced you can also start configuring

 mIRC's features to suit your own needs and tastes, features such

 as colours, fonts, function keys, aliases, popup menus, scripts,

 sounds and many others.



 Remember to visit the mIRC homepage at http://www.mirc.co.uk or

 one of it's mirror sites regularly for the latest information,

 as well as for links to other mIRC and IRC related information

 and websites.



 Good luck and have fun!



 Khaled
