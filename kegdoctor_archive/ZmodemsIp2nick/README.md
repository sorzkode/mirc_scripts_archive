I.) The Info



a.) Who Am I?

    

    My name on IRC is Zmodem. I've been scripting for the

    bulk of about 4 years. I have released many addons in the past, and

    have enjoyed writing them. The best part about writing an addon

    that people like is getting feedback (It's awesome). If you want to

    send me feedback on whether you liked/dis-liked/hated this addon,

    please send all info to: justinterri@netzero.net ANY feedbac is

    greatly appreciated (except mail bombs ;)) Thanks!



b.) What Does This Addon Do?

    

    This addon, IP 2 NICK, tries to convert any ip address into a

    nickname of someone. If the person is not on the same server you

    are on, I am sad to say that this will NOT detect them. It does

    reply a multiple amount of nicknames, depending on who owns the

    IP. This addon is good for 2 reasons (for me anyway):



    1.) If you are nuked:

      

      If you are nuked, you can quickly look up the person's nickname

      by merely going to your menubar, then going to 'Zmodem's

      IP2NICK', then to IP conversion. In there, it will have YOUR IP

      in the 'IP' text box. Remove that one, and type/paste the IP of

      the person who nuked you. It should, if they are on your server,

      quickly resolve their nick and any other nicknames that they own

      that are currently connected.

      

    2.) Flooders:

      

      If someone decides that it might be fun to flood you or your

      channel, you can get the IP of one of the flooders, merely typing

      /DNS <nickname> and then go to IP2NICK and put that IP in the IP

      textbox. This will resolve all of the nicknames of the current

      flooders, making it much easier to determine the 'OWNER'. Usually

      the owner has a normal nick and his clones have random nicks

      (i.e. X8i9s2lx74n).





II.) How To Install



a.) Instructions



    Hopefully, by now, you have unzipped all of the files that were

    included in this ZIP archive into your mIRC folder YOU MUST make

    sure that you UNZIPPED this addon and this readme file into your 

    MIRC folder. You can unzip it to any folder within your mIRC

    folder, but it MUST at least be in the mIRC folder tree.

    

    Now, go into your mIRC program and type the following:

                  

                  /load -rs folder.where.addon.is.stored\ip2nick.mrc



    The addon should take over and finish everything for you.

    (NOTE: You can find all of the options under your MENUBAR in mIRC)
