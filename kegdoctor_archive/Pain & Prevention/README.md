Pain & Prevention version 2.0 



===============

Introduction

===============



Pain & Prevention is a script for mIRC 5.71 by me, Death On Legs. Pain & Prevention (hereafter refered to as P&P) is a -very- fully featured script which is aimed at making the life of all IRC users more enjoyable, safer and convienient. Pain & Prevention automates many aspects of the day to day running of IRC. It also protects you from many malicious ascpects of IRC, such as Floods, DCC Bombs and Virii. P&P is not all serious however. It has an incredible mp3 player, one of the most, if not -the- most advanced mp3 player (frontend) in existence. It also has other features such as XDCC and TDCC as well as a Fileserver and FTP advertisment. This assists the sharing of files via IRC.
